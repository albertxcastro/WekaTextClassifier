5,I use Spotify all the time. I love being able to hear whatever song I like at any given time. Its a wonderful app!
3,Please make it possible to select/copy the lyrics so its easier to translate/print. Thanks anyway for the great listening quality you guys are providing. Cheers
5,Create Playlist and maintain similar artist programs excellent sound
5,So far my favorite app for music. Makes playlists for me and what I listen to and being able to find stations based off artists is the best part. Keep pushing an awesome app.
5,Works as advertised! Everything I want and need. Also love the fact that I dont have to worry about sensorship. They dont remove stuff because it goes against mainstream propaganda.
1,It keeps playing and then shutting off playing and then shutting off. Uninstalling now!
3,Not stable loads of bugs here and there. Now i can not edit my playlists although i am a premium user. The 3 dots on the side of the song dont give me the option to edit and when i emder the playlists there are no 3 dots available for the playlist.
4,I like Spotify just sometimes have User issues trying to get a better handle so I can use in my car easier.
2,I hate the updated spotify cause I cant choose what music I want to play it just randomly pick its own I hate this
3,I would give it a 5 but everything I get in my Benz it starts playing on my phone. I wish I could prevent it from playing on my phone. Will have to drop paid version if I cant figure it out.
2,I hear more ads then music they are often annoying or not family friendly. The music variety is the best but its a downer that I need to listen to 4 minutes of ads for a 3 minute song.
5,I had Pandora before and it was draining my battery. Then I have tried Spotify and my battery issues are gone also the selection of music its way better Im pretty happy using Spotify.
4,Too much adds. I know you get money from it but Why every time I wanna play a song an add pops up??? Its annoying also the add to hear 30 minutes is fake. I had no other apps to hear music to support the artist.
1,Songs I previously downloaded are now showing as not downloaded because I updated the app. Rubbish I have to start over and download over 200 songs thats really bad..
5,Love this app! I noticed a lot of free loaders complaining about the app and its limitations etc. for users who dont pay for the app. To be honest you expect the developers to give you a free ride over their hardwork? They too have bills and royalty to pay. If you are not willing to pay a person for their work then its best to just keep quiet. For me a customer who does pay for the app Im very happy with it.
3,Edit 2022: those stars keep bouncing I guess...since 12/21/21 even though a long-time premium member the app refuses to update many of my favorite shows...now going on another month of paying for a pretty frustrating experience. Yall are gonna drive me back to another service if you cant sort this stuff.
5,Ive used Spotify for probably 9 years now its earned the 5 stars. Great app free version and premium!
1,Well this sucks now want to listen to music? Well u will get one chance to listen to it for free and screen off no ads after that u cant play it again just boom other song just plays also when u notice u just skipped the song u want to listen they wont let u becuz the rewind button is ded always
5,Enjoying the app. The array of songs and other content is great. The suggestions are spot on.
3,This is not an accurate rating for I have not really been on this app for long (or maybe thats just my sucky memory). But I like it so far. I just want to get this whole rating thing over with.
2,In the past (4/5 months) there was not so much ads but nowday(2022) the ads are like rain drops:droplet: every 2/3 mins ads is for surepls do something for this problem or else many people will surely shift to other apps
1,I hate this update and why did you unabled all my playlist? I cant even listen to whatever music that I wanted adds keeps popping up stop focusing on money. This ruined it.
5,I love Spotify! I use it everyday and I love all the features like new release radar on repeat automatic Playlist and radios based on artists you love
5,Love it. Not a day goes by where I dont listen to Spotify. It would be cool if there was a shuffle playlists feature :grin:
3,Good for android watch not for ios. It works perfectly with my galaxy watch but for Apple watch this app is worst constant crashes and offline mode issues faced in Apple watch.
2,Has become absolutely horrible cant play music while opening another app without the whole spotify app closing. Checked all settings none restricting it from background activity yet it still crashes/stops playing everytime i leave the app.
5,Wow! I TRULY ENJOY SPOTIFY for SURE. I like it alot. When you pay for a premium subscriptions you get to skip around and play what ever artist you are in the mood for. Play what you like when you like. The mistro of my Spotify music can mix it up and stream what ever the the misto in control feels like. He or she can mix it up for everyones liking! GO ahead Down load SPOTIFY YOU WONT REGRET IT. THE BEST STREAMING MUSIC APP TO DATE! (in my opinion) and get to streaming your favorite MUSIC!
4,Great range and variety. Easy to use.
2,Its doesnt update fast enough and there re songs I cant find here. I like the app but its limited to a lot of things. Thats y I prefer YouTube music
1,The playlist doesnnt work random songs that are not added are being played and it doesnt make me skip them i waited 2 hours and it still doesnt make me skip them i cant delet them cause if i do it will just say HIDDEN from This play list HIDDEN only HIDDEN is what it saidit was not removed i checked everything and when i played it again after a few songs it starts playing again and i cant find it i only putted 5 songs on the playlist why is there 6 playing this happend to 4 Of my friends also
5,Best streaming app Ive used. I love the personalized playlists more than anything. Its a great service.
1,I hate this app so much. I installed it but I cannot sing up. Whenever I try it shows something went wrong. What hellacious is that!
3,Works great when it works. Sadly whenever there is a update its common to break the lock screen controls (as they are broke now) and cause more issues than they ever fix. For minor bug fixes we lose all functionality for weeks until its fixed... which its probably going to be broken by the following update again.Shame as a premium user I couldnt complain aside from these issues the music library is great the new lyrics are appreciated and the apps easy to use when it wants to be anyway
1,About half the time the mobile app just doesnt respond and the other half its slow. My other apps are working fine. The rest of my family all with different phones are having the exact same problem. Maybe Spotify could invest more in making their app work? Instead they paid 100 million to Joe Rogan who is spreading medical misinformation in the middle of a disastrous pandemic.
3,its a great app! Just a few suggestions : � itd be great if Spotify allows to change the background of lyrics to customise! � need a translate option for the non - English songs i listen to! Let us translate the lyrics musixmatch spotify
3,Its good and the experience was not bad but can you add download option plss:love_letter:
5,It cool app given going from tape to class to now streaning meaning killer librys of music I would not have the chance to hear. My family makes car mixs and event mix with Spotify
5,It is an amazing app. All the songs are available in this app. Very nice app for listening to music.
2,Please please reduce the ads. They say 30mins and there is an ad again after 1 song. Not good. Spoils everything!! Just two things i wanna suggest:- I) add an option for Listen later just like Youtube has watch later option! II) Reduce the number of ads in non-premium! Edit: Do u even watch your customer reviews?
3,Everytime my phone restarts or shuts down everything I ve downloaded dissappears and I have to download them again and again every time.. I use SD Card storage and not the phones storage. (Galaxy s20 ultra) Please fix this :( despite this Spotify is my favourite app no problems excellent app!
1,Support is a joke. No phone support at all just email (Very common USA business model these days) Its all bots with total BS replys to waste peoples time with zero help. And the kicker is !!!......I just wanted to become a premium member and was having some difficulty and needed some help. Good luck if you need help from them
2,The app is good but their many songs and artist profiles from the county that i live and have subscribed with (Tanzania) that show they are not available in my country this is surprising because why would Spotify say not available in the country they were made in with the domestic language. Please change this.
5,Not bad at all sometime it cant play songs.but over all it is good so far.Any song you want or like is there every time. It is perfect.
2,To much ads  Ads are too frustrating please remove these ads :confounded:
3,The App-built is very good so kudos to the devs but awful Ad experience (too many ads in one go and that too too many times). 2 stars taken for that. I switched from saavn (which is was so good until jio came).
4,This app is comfortable to hear the music. But why did you give four stars? Because of ads. And there is no skip. I must be waited 20+sec. But the ads is fine! Love this app.
5,App seem a bit broken on the newest Android os. In my car it suddenly starts playing even if I had exited the app 10min before that. Other app is also having difficulty to get audio through since Spotify is not giving away its position as the main player for some reason.
1,Very disappointed. I make an all Male country station but you play nothing but suggested female artists. I made a playlist for a reason. Those are the songs I want to hear. Why not add a feature abling mixing suggested songs to a current playlist. Im not going to upgrade to premium untill I am offered full control of playlists. I also dont like when you add a song after searching for an artist to have to search for the artist again to access their full discography. Why act like pandora and Ihrt
2,Functionality has gone down. Car mode is gone now I need to buy something called a car thing. For some reason the band sleep (stoner metal) got a fall to sleep album put on their page. My Playlists dont play all the way through either skipping songs or going to previously heard songs
2,The app great and all you get any song at the swipe of a finger but my problem is why do the keep double charging me The first time I payed for premium plan three days later they charged me again i.e I pay double the amount a month which really sucks :disappointed: This is the third time they doing it For now am gonna switch to free till they fix the problem If not Im switching to other streaming service
5,Greatest streaming app on the entire store huge collection of songs with HQ sound. And whats make it the best is that it works in all regions unlike Apple & YT Music.
4,Oh man Spotify works great for me. I just love songs. I like listen to them every second no matter what I an doing songa are always there in background. Just the fact that the ads really interupt the music session.
3,Not able to listen already downloaded music while using the app on the phone. When listening on the tablet no problem. Same account
3,1 ad i could deal with 2 ads ok whatever BUT 3 ADS??? IN A ROW TOO???? that is so dumb and idk why but whenever i want to look at what else is the there in an album or playlist the more button doesnt work anymore so i have to go through THE WHOLE PLAYLIST with only 6 skips and ADS!!! A MILLION OF ADS!! That is so stupid if i could download anything else i would but unfortunately this is the only app thats decent enough. Spotify please get rid of the million of ads and go back to 1
5,I wake up to Spotify. Its myriad Playlists  for different moods is perfect for any music lover.
1,Stop recommend podcasts to me! Get them out of the majority of the UI or make a new tab. I just want to see the music I listen to and maybe some music recommendations with a small scroll.
4,I love this app bcs it has wide range of songs but I think it will be better if I can download only 1 song that I like rather than having to download all songs in a playlist. I hope spotify can consider this. Plus... I updated my spotify app regularly but still I cant see the song lyrics on my smartphone:pensive:
5,It is really the best music app Ive ever used theres not any single issue happening in this Spotify wrapped was so good the music quality the playlist everything is great... Thank you Spotify for this great experience!
4,Its an awesome app but the only thing I hate is the ads...its too frequent nowadays..and sometimes when I got to uninstall the app and reinstall after few min all the songs dissapear and Ive had to re-search and add the songs to my playlist again but this happens very rarely maybe youve fixed it and thats great. Overall I really love this app..user friendly and amazing songs are made jus for you. :heart:?:heart:?
4,i really like this app all my favourite songs are available but the ads after evey couple of songs is irritating and frustrating i hope you can resolve this problem
5,As a DJ and music connoisseur this app allows me to store play and discover not only my favorite tracks but also my future favorite tracks. It is like having the ultimate record collection without the debt or storage space required physically or digitally. Spotify rocks!!!
1,Crashes constantly doesnt display the podcast you are actually listening to pause and play button doesnt work most of the time. Trash.
1,I cant change the play order from shuffle to in order when listening to an album. This is a seriously deficient app. Take a lesson from Garmin the most user friendly company in the world and no I do t work for them.
1,My songs arent playing inspite of having a high speed internet connection. Everytime i try to play a song it says you are offline. Please fix this bug spotify.
4,I love Spotify however some of the safety features can be annoying such as if Im a passenger in a vehicle but my Spotify is connected to the car I cant watch the video attached to the podcast Im watching. Also I occasionally have connectivity issues. Otherwise its great.
1,This is a waste of time! DONT DOWNLOAD this dumb app. Its just a waste! Need Data to play music!!? Then you need a premium music to play it offline!!!! Itll need to spend money to buy a premium!!!! How sucks!!!! JUST DONT DOWNLOAD THIS SUCKED APP
1,Im not sure what going on but I cant play any music or podcasts without the audio stopping every 5 seconds. Even after a Uninstall/reinstall the problem persists
4,I would put five stars and I have had this app for quite a while and I havent had a problem until TODAY. My music keeps cutting out in the middle of the songs. So can I hear a solution soon please so I can fix this problem? Or is there going to be an update soon?
1,Alt every other minute. Auto connect to my other device. It is nightmare. They used to be the best.
1,Awful experience for the first time I have no clue why does anyone find this service useful I wasnt able to play a *single* song without spotify shuffling to 30 other random ones that I dont care one bit for. If I wanted to listen to random unskippable songs that I dont care about I would have turned on my grampas radio
5,I really like this app but a friendly suggestion I had to turn on explicit content to get a couple of songs I like. Dont know why they dont even have cuss words really G-rated material. Please check your explicit content to see if they actually belong there. Thanks again I really like the app.:stuck_out_tongue:
5,I like the fact that the original artist is always used or is included in a particularly favorite song. Other apps will use another artist to sing your favorite song and passed them off as the original singer.
5,excellent app for music. I have Spotify Premium and I personally believe it is well worth the money. I have discovered so much new music from recommendations in the app so I am definitely satisfied.
1,It sucks. Cant pick my song or skip songs. It was a mistake to download this. I cant pick a song in a album or repeat a song. It sucks. Dont waste your time downloading it. Fix it.qhen I try to listen to a song it plays something totally different like 95% of the time this app sucks. Fix all of this stuff. I cant even pick a song in an album. Fix it now.
3,Sometimes I wonder how an app this unstable and buggy could reach world dominance in streaming market. I mean I love the curated playlists music selection and everything on content and music side in general but purely on software side its pretty bad. I tried YT Music Deezer GPM and Spotify is clearly the worst of them all. Interface lags and stutters all the time frequently loses internet connection streaming to devices sometimes is PITA. I dont know whether its poorly optimized...
5,I LOVE this app! Cant imagine my life without it! They make awesome Playlists for you and have every song I ever wanted. Even some local bands I wanted to hear. Amazing! Thanks Spotify!
3,Its good and works well but the the problem here is sometimes I lost all my downloaded songs even if I didnt delete them or remove the downloads. Its pissing me off sometimes because i have to redownload them again.
5,Got my Spotify app inspite of the failed cancelation of Joe Rogan. Love it! Watch him all the time. Had it from the very beginning with all the music you can find anywhere. After I had my phone stolen I had to reinstall it. I didnt have the cloud back-up. That wont happen again.
1,Spotify is bs. Pandora is better because atleast doesnt have a limit on FREE. Your ads were on a loop for a while. If you think Im gonna pay with money I dont got and try a trap me with loops of ads.... then not only is this a shifty app its getting reported everyday. Dont like it dont con people.
4,I would give Spotify five stars but the fact that it shows ads every 30 minutes and only shuffle plays your playlists can be quite annoying. If only the Spotify app work just like Spotify on the internet then I would truly be glad.
2,Hate this app so much now. Spotify became so money hungry and so many ads CANT listen to one song without hearing 4 ads in a row like Im not even kidding. I got 5 ads in a row
3,I cant find any podcast that should be in the app I cant find any podcasts at all. Already deleted the app and installed again but nothing changed. Not even having a premium account makes any difference.
5,Spotify always hits the spot of feelings when i need a song. They have a great selection and never disappoints.
5,This streaming service is very laggy and its so hard to listen to even a single 3 minute song without it taking 18 minutes to play til the end. I was so unhappy with it I decided to use it as toilet paper and now I need a new phone
4,Great for.music and stuff just wish you could pock a single song and that it wasnt on shuffle the whole time to make it free other than that Ive got no problems
2,It is a relatively good app I have been using it on my laptop for a while nowit is easy to use and has great features however Im struggling to access my musiceven my offline music on my phone as it is continuously loading
1,Love the service but the app experience is awful. Everything takes ages to load the app doesnt seem to be able to handle switching networks and sometimes things just wont play at all.
5,The app works great music selection is great and the amount of adds is acceptable.
5,The app just keeps getting better. I love that I can download songs and they continue to strive to attain the rights to all my favorite songs. They even have Decode by Paramore now!! My favorite thing lately is being able to sing along as I read the lyrics in the app!
4,If not for the ads it would be the perfect app obviously if you spend money to remove apps its better but then free comes with a cost..
4,I love it! Its fun to use but I gave it 4 stars cuz it has ads that pop up ever so often and since I cant use the premium version I can only skip six songs per hour other than that the app is really fun to use!
1,The worst :tired_face: they are trying to push people to subscribe to premium service by cutting out some of the privileges of listening to music like skipping songs. Its a waste of time bundles and space DO NOT download.
1,Please just stop. Why is it that random songs not even in my playlist just randomly play. I just want to listen to the songs in my playlist in sure others feel the same
4,I love Spotify but recently my favorite Playlist that I created years ago got destroyed by some Indian dude who put 70+ hours of Indian techno music and deleted a lot of songs that I love. My 34 hour long Playlist was now a 105 hour long mess. Some how the Playlist was defaulted to collaborative and it got ruined. Yes I fixed the problem but I should have never had one!
1,I dont know whats happened in the last 2 updates but my music/podcast will just stop playing several times in a hour. Very annoying and frustrating. Ive tried uninstalling and updating... nothing has worked to fix this issue
5,Beat you tube any day !: So easy to understand for people who arent any good with technology ! Keep up the good work Spotify :sparkling_heart:.
4,Would give it five stars but I am not able to buy Spotify premium with Google Play Credit. And its the only way because I dont have a PayPal or a credit card :/
4,It is still great but over time it became more confusing with a lot of new stuff. Also app speed has decreased.
2,Was an ok service but I dont like how each time you log in then shut it down for the day it uses storage rom. After a few days you look at your storage and its hogging almost 2-3 gbs. Thats just asinine and totally unneeded for a streaming service that already eats up data. But also eats up Rom as well? Nah I had to say goodbye to my premium account. Ill find another.:v:?
2,When I started using this app it was working well but then 1 month in and the app starts making a glitch in were I cant select a song and it says This action can not be performed now and it is frustrating and if it was a month ago or if they fixed the bug I wouldve rated it 5 stars but unfortunately this annoying problem popped up.
1,I dont understand the methodology of development here. I have a Free account and the web player on PC/Laptop works splendid. I can choose songs within an album to play. I can only play a sequence or shuffle in the mobile app. How crude and cruel of a development team do you have to be to not have the same exact functions on phone apps as they are on PCs??
2,I have done all steps your team is suggesting I cleared all cache and data I logged out and signed in againI reinstalled the app. The video clips arent working anymore and the canvas option is not existing. Also I cant share my lyrics even though other people with older devices can and of course the app is updated! Please fix it!!!
2,For some reason I cant play songs or my playlist. At first I was able to listen in my free time but now I cant. To add to that everytime I leave Spotify it logs out on its own! And I downloaded it a few days ago too :( .
1,It was a superb app a few years ago. No keep stopping playing music (even when good reception) struggle to control other devices you cant adjust volume on other device the widget doesnt work on Samsung. While on Android Auto the app keep crushing. Do not recomend.
1,Garbage. Too bad its the only option. When selecting offline playback takes forever to open for some reason. Periodically the audio starts and stops for no reason. Works perfectly if the screen is on. Problem persists through several updates.
5,I have had Spotify for over seven years now. Ive never had any issues. The only music app I will ever use!
5,An excellent service that offers tons of great music for a fair price. The algorithim that Spotify created helps me find the music I like. I can even listen to an entire music channel based on the sound of one song or artist Ive selected.
3,Honestly... It is very annoying when you search for a song and another comes on instead. Despite that its a wonderful app. Playlists are absolutely wonderful
2,Continues to get stuck on one song album art while others continue to play album art never changes. I have tried clearingy cache. This has been a ongoing issue.
5,Love this music app  I own an iPhone and prefer this over Apple music only con is (not many lyrics to the songs...well when day come thru with all these lyrics it gotta get corrected thanks for all the lyrics Spotify is my Spot
2,Very glitchy on my phone tracks keep pausing randomly. Says Im playing something Im not and doesnt update display so says Im still listening to a podcast I played yesterday when Im actually listening to something else. Really annoying and not what I expect for a paid-for service.
5,Had a few bugs such as liked songs diasapearing from months ago but appart from that Spotify premium has always offered fair pricing and is essential for the music fanatic :)
1,While theres a huge amount of songs to choose from on this app you cant actually listen to the exact song unless you pay for premium even when you add it to your Playlist you cant listen to it because thr only available thing is shuffle playwhich plays your songs at random until it decides to stop and play recommended.
5,Their capacity to suggest music based on favorites and song content is great. I never give reviews. Why should I? But this service has very good value. They now have lyrics. Whoa! Horsepower. Earthpower. Seapower. Just float along.
2,As others have noted recently the app has become a hot garbage can of code. The song name freezes on the notification screen so you never see the song youre actually listening to and now the entire app just pauses out of nowhere and stops playing music sporadically. For all the money Spotify has made from pod casters (Joe Rogan having an audience 10x as popular as CNN) youd think these clowns would put the money in to make sure their app didnt run about as well as a cheap mobile game.
4,let me listen to different tracks on different devices even if its only on wifi. I play Spotify for my dog while I work in the other room so it would be nice to be able to listen to Spotify while Im working but preferably not the sleep sounds my dog is listening to.
4,Absolutely incredible app cant go without it. I would vote 5 stars but some podcasts have adds. I have premium membership I should never see adds
5,Great app & youre not pressured to pay. I can put up with a few commercials for this great music you pick yourself!!!
5,As a student this platform is a Godsend. I play various tunes while I work. Whether Im in the mood for chill lofi beats peppy afrobeat or even saxophone classics Spotify has it all. 5 stars for sure. However I wish there was a feature where you can invite someone to listen to your playlist.
5,Very good. Great sound . I do miss YouTube musics video but I left them because of their strangling of free speech  in relation to the covid debacle. I really appreciated spotify standing its ground and not taking down Robert Malone podcast with Seth Rogan.
1,Spotify has been constantly crashing and buggy lately. Losing sound until I restart skipping like a trackman when my phone has the screen off. Poor connectivity to my google home devices. Will stop paying for my membership if not fixed soon.
2,Hot garbage! Songs cant be played in order of the album instead thats a premium feature. Yet this is a default feature on say Xbox. Edit: The devs are saying premium shouldnt be premium? X for Doubt
3,Ok so I really like this app. You can listen to pretty much every song you can think of BUT Six ads before I can listen to a song is definitely too much! I cant afford Premium since 10� a month isnt cheap and I think its okay to have one ad every 5th song or so but Six ads bin a row is WAY to much!!! And the PC version also Bugs very often. Then they show a Song u have played 10mins ago but play another one. Its frustrating!
4,Only gripe is a bug in the notifications navigator bar. It would stay stuck on one track sometimes. Restarting the app and playing a new track will add both tracks to the bar letting you swipe between the two. But controlls for both will only playback the most recent track.
2,I like it but it says recommended songs and it waits to the one I want till last I want this to change I have seen lots of other people talking bout this but u have not done anything to solve it. Do u really want to start a war because people cant listen to the songs they want so either book your ideas up or lots of people will start to not pay for premium. Premium is is but it doesnt help when u want to listen to the song u like. SO PLZZZZ CAHNGE THIS OR GIVE US A FREE TRIAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,My only issue is that there was an update a few years ago that took away the search bar feature within your library on Android phones. Give me my search bar back my iPad still has one?!
3,I get 4-5 ads everytime. 1-2 is ok to handle. But in the gap of 15-20 min handling 4-5 times same thing really sucks... Having said that the quality of music is wonderful.
3,Having a problem with the gapless option. It just keeps turning off so I have to open the app every 2 songs. Please fix it!!
4,Do they have 10 year olds programming for them? Every update gets worse and worse and worse. Completely unusable junk. Heres a tip for the developers.. if its not broken stop trying to fix it.
5,I like the fact that Spotify will play music by a specific artist only  however when they switched formats it is hard for me to locate all of my artists that I had previously on my app and I have to go in and search for the artist.
2,It was working fine until a couple minutes ago when it player the wrong song halfway through said wrong song and didnt work at all. Might of been my Wi-Fi but I was at three bars please fix
1,Man this app is great but the problem is thatin this app there are limitless ads.Means if a person does not want to take a premiumwhy this app force him to take it.I have experienced that we hear ads more than the songs.So plz reduce the ads limits:rage:
1,Very bad experience. if you listen most of time on sortify then you will have an add after every song .
1,Firstly this app is the best app for music .. I love it but since 1 month their is some glitch lyrics are not available .. not even of single song please solve this issue ASAP.
1,It has so much bugs nowadays that it shows No Internet even if the connection is there. And I couldnt access songs that I have saved and liked. I couldnt listen to music on this platform so Time to switch the music app!
5,Havent used spotify since its debut n I loved the idea than but didnt have that umph it needed. Now I picked my artist like usual play a few songs from here n there genres and BOOM playlists r popping up everywhere n majority of those songs r related or even better depending on the mood ur in. Im loving it.
2,im pretty bummed because i have a new android phone and the spotify equalizer now opens up my audio effects app instead of a graphic eq panel like on my old iphone.
5,Be using for years always super easy to navigate and organize playlists. Highly recommend use mostly because I can organize my specific music taste unlike other music players.
3,Man it would be nice if I didnt have to watch five adds just to play a song after opening it and also it says Ill get 30 minutes and no it doesnt I should get a couple hours if I have to watch like 10 ads just to watch 2 song that are like 5 minutes long like please just fix this I wouldnt buy premium anyways because I just want to listen to my music for at least 4 songs like come on Spotify I have downloaded this before and it had no problem ever since last update it hasnt been the same.
4,Spotify is a great app but these ads... Ughhhh so annoying guys pls fix it :pray: Im just a student and can afford to buy the premium . Reduce the no. of ads that will be a lot helpful
1,Annoying! When Im looking for a song Im given only playlists and not the song itself and when I play the song I want in the playlist Im given a different song and I have to skip to find the song I want . It�s really annoying especially when you still have to wait an hour for just six skips
5,To me this app has been my second world that I am living since I discovered the app as I am a Music lover....I love the apps interface....and overall features...I am so grateful for such a wonderful app....
5,Its great for a free app it already includes the lyrics of the songs you can add or customize your queue or playlists and everything is so simple to use!
5,This is the best app for music. But i have one problem please dont embarrass with those adds regarding Spotify premium as not all of us are able to take the premium version. And i am not saying that stop those adds but just limit it like the adds should come after 9-10 songs. Thank you
1,It is a poor experience after downloading at first you are able to choose any song you like but then you can only hear the songs which they recommend and you cant even skip back or forward the song......worst:face_vomiting: it doesnt even deserve any star.
4,ALWAYS states that Im offline although Im not. Apparently this problem has been going on since 2012 and STILL hasnt been fixed. Its 2022 guys. Really?! :face_with_raised_eyebrow:
5,Its an amazing app at first I always downloaded my songs from YouTube with a converter to my phone. I always told my friends how many good things I could do with the playlist on my phone for free than when you compared that with spotify. But about a month ago I was persuaded by friends to try spotify out at least. And it was so much better than expected. Both thumbs up!!:+1|type_1_2::+1|type_1_2: Im not gonna delete it as I actually would have expected.
4,Please enable a switch for album art on the lock screen! It would be nice if we had the choice to turn it on or off Google Music has this feature.
1,Its even a worse app then before I cant listen to the songs I want it adds bulsjit music to music that dont even match it like it would add rap songs to a calming Playlist
3,There are many songs that are not seen in this app. For eg. Winter bear by BTS V or unplugged versions of Bollywood songs that are better than the OST
5,Update: They brought back the :rewind::black_right_pointing_triangle_with_double_vertical_bar::fast_forward: AND driving mode. :blue_heart::grin: � 3/21: Love Spotify. Had it for many years on PC. Would give 5 ?s if Spotify would include itself and the :rewind::black_right_pointing_triangle_with_double_vertical_bar::fast_forward: buttons on the drop down notification bar on Androids for quicker access to them like it used to. It was b/c of this feature that I deleted other apps. Having to minimize all apps to reopen Spotify app and then reopen the track just to get the :rewind::black_right_pointing_triangle_with_double_vertical_bar::fast_forward: menu is a bummer... I need this feature back please.
1,Fix your downloads and make it more user friendly. Give me the ability to remove multiple downloads. When I click download it takes forever to load the app become glitchy.
1,Cant even play the song I want to play let us freely control our songs and our wants. You add songs on are playlist thinking we would like them WE WOULDNT. Dont force us listen to those songs let us control the songs we want to play cmon
5,Its really been an awesome experience its so sooo nostalgic my oldies playlist on Spotify takes me back to my Secondary School & University days. I love the feeling. Thanks Spotify.
2,App stopped working when used for an alarm with Google home again. Very frustrating to not be able to depend on an alarm clock.
1,It was good with the loops for songs that really got me in a good mood but today when I went into it I had songs I didnt add and had to watch 3 adds just to listen to my song once!!!!
5,The only music app I use. It has everything I could want! Except for some of my favorite comedians.. but hopefully theyre working on that so..
5,So far its been a wonderful experience exploring several genres of music of my choice. Impressive!
5,Moved over from amazon music after amazon just wouldnt play my extensive playlists over the alexa and also just on an aux in my car. Utterly frustrating when there long drives to be had to university and its my only alone time away from 2 kiddos self care in important. Spotify has worked perfectly the tracks it recommends are on point after only using it for a month its got my taste down to a tea. Really user friendly even my 5 and 9 year old can make their own playlists.
5,The Best streaming app on the Planet. Has cast function  delivers all the latest tracks at my fingertips.
1,Before the update it was amazing. Unlimited skips no ads high quality sound etc. But now I hate it so much. Spotify if you see this please change this app into like before the update. First of all when I wanted to listen to a song that unskippable 15 seconds ad pops up. I had to close the app and reopen it. Its so annoying! Second of all why cant I pick a specific song i wanted to? Its so hard to use! Please Spotify reply me if you saw this!!!
4,Its a great app but whenever I use it and Im using another app at the same time it just stops the song in between and I have to go back to the app to open the song and it also restarts it
3,I think its cool. I recently shuffled a playlist and every song Ive tried to play has been shuffled on some list I am supposed to preview and like/dislike all before I listen to the song I wanted to play in the first place. Thats been frustrating to me.
2,Was better. Now they are always trying to push me listen something I dont want to or didnt ask. Cant customize home page so its full of playlists that I dont want. Very annoying.
5,Its so nice to be able to select the music that I want to enjoy any tome of day or night. Commercial Free is the big bonus also. From one artist to many songs of the style. My mood for music changes and Spotify has everything I love.
1,Latest Update NEEDS TO BE FIXED. Song screen freezes and doesnt allow you to switch songs. Next song plays but the widget and all other wearables show the frozen song info. VERY FRUSTRATING!!!
1,I am using the versi�n premium in South korea I dont know why the lyrics appear in romanization the application doesnt have a option to decide what Languages can be use for the lyrics the usar should decide see in the original language or romanization ?.? Totally disappointed :disappointed:
1,Continuously playing for about 60 seconds. Kindly tell us whether we wanna use this application or not. One or two ad is fine... But this is totally annoying
5,This is the best music Ive come across ever since. I just have one problem with. If I ever sign out when I log in again I find all my downloads gone and i have to download all the songs again. Anyway besides that this is the best streaming app for everyone. Yall gotta check it out
3,My experience right now is makes playlist to listen to music I like then Spotify plays recommended songs and I try to skip or hide songs in the playlist because I dont like the suggested songs and Spotify eventually says hey you should edit your playlist. Thanks! Good thing these suggested songs that I dont like are in my playlist :) I am being sarcastic. There are songs I dont like that arent in my playlist. I made a playlist so I could listen to songs I like not unskippable sug. songs
5,I used to love Spotify. But now the same issue came up twice. I cannot play some particular songs. Logging out/in isnt helping at all reinstalling the app helps for a while but then the issue comes back. Please fix this ASAP. I really want my music back.
4,Good app with heaps of good features but its not quite perfect. Often the app double downloads albums in my library so I have manually remove them it freezes often enough to get irritating on all devices I have and I sometimes have to reinstall the app because of random glitches. When those issues aint happening spotify is great but they do.
1,The app is just becoming a trash  whenever I try to open the app  they say no internet connection  but my network is good  so please check these error!!
4,I use every single day. However. I use music for day and sleep at night. Wish I had profile options. I pay premium. I want day music and sleep music to be separate because sleep music destroyed my recommended music for day time..... need day and night profiles for Plaistow to keep algorithms separate options .
1,Plan on deleting this app after I explain the one star so yall wanna tell me why I need premium to chose the song I wanna listen to? How does that make sense and my shuffle play plays songs I have never searched up which is even worse Im certain that there are so many other people who feel the same way as me the exact same way
3,_outdated UI _Cant customise Homescreen its all sposored or suggested content _Artist list items are too big (requires extensive scrolling even worse on desktop apps) _Cant browse by genre or year of release _Suggestions are the same thing over and over again _cant filter remasters and live versions from new releases At least the music availability is not too bad.
3,cancelled. Replaced with YouTube music. I am in Thailand seems to work much better than Spotify which for me was getting glitchier all the time I think. Drop outs...sounding like a scratched CD....failure to properly communicate with google while driving....all add up. If I find a replacement with driving mode...I will jump.
3,This is one of the good app for streaming audio but i have request if u could make the advertisement lesser because its so annoying to listen 3 ads at a same time. more than songs ads plays its just so annoying.
5,Excellent availability I cant say every song can be found but theres more than enough music to go through. Love the improvements concerning lyrics and the overall layout of the platform.
2,Your ads are too irritating! . Everyone is not capable to buy your damn Premier understood. I am not telling to stop ads but please stop begging after every two songs man!
4,Has tons of songs and pod casts the only down side is if dont have Facebook you cant add friends but even still you can just follow them. Spotify will even put an e at the top of a song if swears which good for younger ages as well as downloading podcasts playlists and songs so if the network drops out you can listen to the downloaded songs. If your a music lover dont hesitate to get the completely free to use app
5,Love Spotify. Has all the music and playlist I love to listen to and I have even discovered some new artist and bands I really enjoy listening to as well.
1,Barely works constantly says Im offline when im next to the router. Wont play podcasts or songs and just sits there i silenced. I wouldnt mind as much apart from the fact im paying for this!
1,When it works its very convenient but it has far too many bugs for such a widely used app and one Im spending 17 aud on a month. Certian songs or podcasts will often just not play for no reason when they would before you sometimes cant access downloads offline because spotify tries to connect the download page to the internet etc. Extremely annoying
3,I can not properly copy the links for anything. The App has this problem already 2 months. For sample I can provide you with the case when this happens. When the copied links are pasted in the telegram the app doesnt recognize it and shows message unsupported browser instead of preview of song album or something else.
4,This is best app for listening music but these days there are ads after every song which is very annoying and irritating but Im happy with this app but I will request you to find the solution for ads
5,Best part is the ease of access on different platforms.. be it windows Android or any web browser.. love it.. awesome controls and playlists
1,Sure the music and everything is fine however the downside to it is how you cannot delete your account from your own Android phone for some reason it gives you too many questions and too many things to do just to get one account removed it shouldnt be this hard
2,I like using this on My PC but the problem is I have using this on my mobile how come I cant pick a song I want to play on my Playlist and how come I cant restart the song all the way to the beginning if I want to? whats the point having a minute line if you cant drag your dot anywhere? third of all whatever I skip a song or played a song it wont let me go back to the previous song I was before its just lazy.
4,They seem a little too desperate in pursuading us into a premium. Ad after each and every song. Too annoying  although they have a vast collection of songs
5,Easy to use across devices seamlessly. Im able to download my favourite music and use offline especially because of intermittent Internet connection in my location.
5,Been Using This App For Years I Love This App :blush::blush: also premium is an amazing feature they have more songs than apple music for instance I listen to alot of Tyga and Apple music doesnt carry some of his music so I honestly cant compare the two Spotify wins
1,Not sure what the hell they have done but it simply isnt working on Android anymore. App seemingly crashes whenever a notification from another app comes in; disappears completely when a song/podcast is paused for longer than 2 seconds and right now is refusing to uninstall. I used to love this app but it is giving way more hassles than ever
1,The app hasnt opened for me in over two weeks despite reinstalling it and all kinds of trouble shooting. I share a duo premium account with my partner and his app is working fine. My screen is and continues to be blank. Thumbs down
1,Buggy doesnt play the song I choose. Right now it started a podcast for no reason. Thanks for losing my spot. Would rate 0 stars if possible. YouTube music is way better!!
5,It is by far the best free music app Ive ever used. I recommend it to everyone. They have every song and artist you can think of. Great job to the developers of Spotify. 5 stars and more if I could give you guys 10 stars I would.
4,Very much like the new Enhance feature has let me add a heap of songs to my playlist that i wouldve added anyways if i had the chance when i first heard them! Ive been having problems where my most recent playlist/songs wont automatically start whenever i start up my car. Additionally driving mode doesnt start sometimes. Id love if these could be fixed as i find i sometimes need to operate the app whilst driving which is against the law for my situation and is unsafe anyways.
2,New update is wacky. Sometimes it shuts down by itself. interaction on car audio I cant tolerate it anymore I wish I didnt update it
2,Missing important feature When I search for a song it plays just that song. No way to see a suggestions list.
1,Garbage app. It will literally skip songs/ podcast randomly. Crashes randomly. It will spontaneously open and start playing even after closing app. Very frustrating to use!
2,Since the update my vehicle (new) aftermarket stereos Spotify Bluetooth app doesnt connect. I had to uninstall and find version 7.9 elsewhere and disable updates. Pls fix. Otherwise pretty happy with the app. Still the case 6 months later.
4,Great app for music just a bunch of adds but thats how they get paid. Minus the premium. But they should do unlimited skips then I would give them 5 stars :)
1,Necessary evil. Ive been a spotify member for years. EVERY update full of bugs that get fixed and replaced by more bugs by the next update. Why cant spotify just work? Love it when it works hate it when it doesnt which is more often than not.
1,Love it for podcasts but I have the premium version but I get ads on the podcasts. Not ones put there by the shows but Spotify ads. They ruin the flow
1,Awful app and user experience. App constantly deletes my downloaded music (this has been an issue for about a decade as youll see from googling) says Im in offline mode when Im not and thus wont let me search for music wont let me play downloaded music that it hasnt yet deleted takes about 5 seconds to load downloaded music etc. Constantly plagued with issues no matter what device I use (Ive tried it on 3 smart phones and 3 desktops). Your developers need to get a grip and wake up.
3,Its fun to listen to music and they have the ones I love but I dont like how they make you listen to the SUGGESTED ones and not the ones on your playlist I barely remember my playlist but when I get the chance to listen to the music I put on my playlist it feels good to listen from this app
2,It use to be really good now I cant even listen to my music because it keeps stopping after 9-11 seconds I use music to help with my anxiety but how can it help when I cant listen this has been going on for like a year now Ive done everything I could to stop it for doing it but still nothing youre a streaming app how can you stream without the music/podcasts playing?
5,I love the curated playlists! They introduced me to new music I love and tracks by my favorite artists that I had not known of. I dont like that you cant download individual songs or just listen to all of your downloaded music as a group regardless across different playlists or albums.
5,Loving Spotify you can even get lyrics to songs! Selection of music available is amazing.
5,Omg thank you spotify for adding lyrics!! Just wish we could pick the songs. But I just love spotify so much!!
1,Played a song I hate as a suggested song after I turned off suggested songs and when I tried to skip it I was told it was a premium feature. (I was not out of skips)
4,When it works its great. Most days it will only play 2-3 songs completely then the first 10s of everything else.
1,The constant erasing of all my downloads is a joke. It has happened 4 of the last 5 days and upteen times previously. I have 2 paid accts but I think Im finally done with spotify. Hope they fix the issue that people have been complaining about since 2017
1,DO NOT USE if you want to actually listen to songs you want. On a playlist I created for 30 minutes I only got songs I did not put in. I did not hear ONE song I had on my playlist.
3,Keeps deleting liked songs for no reason it show but skip them. Than I look them up and on their like if I didnt have them starred/liked. Even paying for the premium but starting to second think the app
4,Its good for streaming music for your Xbox pc and the like but you cant play a specific song it adds songs to playlists automatically and the ads are nonstop. But besides that it does the job.
3,Lots of issues with the music play stopping all the time. Also kicks me out of my liked songs and plays random garbage annoying as hell
2,I have had a Spotify Premium account for the past three years and Ive enjoyed the experience. So much so that I upgraded to a Family account but now the other members that I added on the plan do not have the lyrics feature but I do. This doesnt make sense.
5,Look no further being interested in some rather obscure musicians! I have not been let down yet. Try it . I didnt find anything that compares . And as a bonus you have access too some great podcast. Be Kind in these trying times ! It cost nothing Rock On!
1,Fix your app it auto plays when not used. And gets stuck on old podcast. 1-17-22 app for Android still turns itself on randomly and plays just starts playing old stuff you listened to and it wont let you turn it off unless you uninstall the app.
3,I cant see and control album tracks .. it only shuffles! Is this because i am in free trail. Its so annoying.
1,Its been working for many months but recently the app just forces the music to stop then u need to open the app again and play and it will start from the beginning sooo inconvenient please fix it
5,Only app or service I use for music podcats and more. Honestly Ive never had an issue with the app or web player. Everyone should drop other music platforms and use this!!
1,Lost my job and now have the free version and its commercial interruption is massive 2 or 3 30 second ads More music recommendations from our picked songs. MOSTLY fix the random play so it plays random and not always the same order of random
4,Now i absolutely love this app but when I go to play a playlist it plays random songs I never put in my playlist and it gets annoying when I have to waste my skips on songs I never added to my playlist. Honestly I would love if you could fix this thank you.
1,If this app installs itself again its done it 3 times Im through with premium Spotify its no damn excuse for it to completely uninstall itself and it happens more than yall admit. DAMN
5,I have used Spotify for years its amazing and they have every song! Even from musicals and TV shows. I bought premium which is just �5 a month I think. You can download music to listen ofline and will still play if your phone is off or on another app. :+1::grin:
4,A good library of classic R&B and Soul.....theres still a good handfull of music it still doesnt have. Hope they dont give up searching to insert these tracks.
1,Worst App for music. Firstly you cant choose where the Playlist starts (I would like the beginning) and then once you get the music to play suddenly a random song comes up (hidden gem they call it) that has ABSOLUTELY no link to the music you want to hear. Playing Disney songs for the kids and suddenly some random music?? Who would pay for such an abysmal app?!
3,Current version doesnt show up in the notification bar or on the lock screen... if I want to know what songs playing or change the track I have to open my phone and go all the way into the app. :/
3,The app was good before premium made you have to pay for half of the features that were free before hand. I cant even go rewind songs without premium
1,Very odd user interface especially on desktop. Genre/playlist searches dont work well and always seem to include songs or albums that dont match the search. Oh and they support and promote Joe Rogan. :clown_face:
3,For me Spotify is just not working it keeps saying something when wrong it doesnt even let me play the songs I want but it is a good app kind of it was good when I first downloaded it but now it not good
3,Its ok but I disabled the playback yet it still keeps playing suggested songs and its really annoying because the suggested songs arent even good
1,As soon the screen is off..it become laggy..already done all step to fix and didnt work..if the screen is on no lag at all. Thinking about stop paying and get another app..
3,Yeah Im disappointed I recently upgraded to premium and that was fine for a while but after every update all my downloads dissappear and wont download again for ages. I was so looking forward to Spotify premium like all my friends but it just doesnt word for me
2,Love the variety of music just really wish songs wouldnt get removed weather it be the artists choice or not such as licensing I dont feel its right anyway. Beyond that I use Spotify over every other platform just wish I could view the covers via clicking on them as I was able to in previous versions to be able to see the art in a lager format is always great and its no longer an option like it was
5,Has lots of great features! I appreciate the lyrics feature being added to all songs it makes singing along a lot better! :)
1,Ive loved aspotify for years and loved it. No nothing works properly. Deleted cache uninstalled /reinstalled Multiple times. Now it wont even download. Too many recent problems with the app over the last 12 mo. To list nothing works anymore.
5,Nice experience handy would love to have my liked shuffled more so that albums are split and mixed more. What I mean is that I would like individual songs to be identified and played from different authors.
3,Please combine Stations and Spotify (matter of fact combine all the individual Spotify apps into one). This is one of the main reasons why I havent switched from Amazon music. Switching between two apps just to hear a STATION is NOT intuitive. Also its a fairly interruptive experience.
4,i have just one problem with this app. i had other account and i could see the lyrics of the songs without any problem. nut now that i have a new account i cant see the lyrics. and i login in other phone with my account and i can see the lyrics. i think its my phone (i have a Samsung Galaxy A20s) but i dont know how to solve this so i really need help. besides i love this app. i dont want to stop using it just because i cant see the lyrics. please help me.
2,Constantly tells me im offline when i have secure 5G and wifi connections. I have to restart the app several times just to search up any song thats not already on my playlist.
5,Love the music selection ability to make Playlist and downloads..recommend to everyone and have my kids and grandchildren all enjoying their music as I do..
5,I like this app very much. Worlds all songs are here I can listen Hindi English and also Punjabi songs anytime and I have made different types of playlist for songs.
4,It is a nice app overall but the ads which pop up after every 2 songs are very annoying.
4,I really enjoy using this app its the best music/podcast app ive had but Ive had the free plan for a while and the number of ads has increased and I wish that the ads stopped advertising premium so much.
5,One of my best app! Spotify= Love:heartbeat: This app has all types of songs like anime jpop which Im so interested in. Even though I didnt have a premium subscription ads became a part of journey and I even sing those ads sometimes too! I use Spotify more than any other app on my device. Thanks for making a great app!:heartbeat:
1,Edit: audio volume adjustment via chromecast protocol stopped working in Android 12 and has to be done with the app open. Sigh here we go again /// The home has become quite confusing. It shows quick access to the features that Spotify wants to push most not what Id like to see and use. Please at least make it customisable with drag and drop or something. Overall the UX has declined significantly compared to a few years ago.
5,Just get premium if u can. Even without the playlists that they make based on your liked songs are usually pretty good. Its better than listing to music on YouTube.
2,Randomly stops playing often displays wrong podcast titles play and pause buttons only work sporadically.
1,The app is full of bugs. Autoplay is not working after a song is selected from search. Tried suggested solutions they dont work. Please fix this. What happens if you are driving a car? You need to select a new song every time? Other bug app doesnt quit when you are on home page and press back.
2,Honestly Ive noticed for a few days now that whenever I click edit playlist or genuinely wanna see the songs I have in my playlist it will show me the song name as the artists name too which is.. rather pathetic. How am I supposed to know what the artist Im listening to if this is happening (and yes it even shows the song name as the artists name in my notifications). Please fix this asap
5,Great app I understand the app generally cant make money without ads. That being said I believe that there are enough listeners subscribed to Spotify premium that they do not need to run advertising in their app I want to clarify that I do not know the statistics of how many users are subscribed to the premium service. It is just my general understanding that a good majority of listeners are subscribed. Over all great experience and great music 9/10 would recommend
1,Stop recommending me podcasts. I dont listen to them anymore. Give me the option to hide them. Im ready to cancel my account and go back to ripping my CDs
1,Bring back the option to delete songs from recently play list. I dont buy the BS excuse about testing new features for best user experience blah blah blah. Its not. This is probably a greedy corporate decision to force users to listen stuff they dont want for more view counts.
2,This version glitches nonstop for podcasts. It doesnt update what Im listening to or where I am in that episode. The notification bar isnt showing up. It randomly stops playing every 10-15 minutes. So annoying.
2,Almost tempted to return to radio or other players due to not being able to play albums in order just cos youre not premium. Functionality is curtailed to what they want you to do and not user experience. Ads also reliant on gambling etc
2,I am fine with even 10 ads every 5 minutes but the ads that try to make you feel guilty about not having premium cross the line and I am not going to be renewing premium because of this.
1,Very poor excuse of a streaming service. Only recommend if you enjoy endless playback errors interruptions and crashes. When reaching out for help the tech team at Spotify will ask you to uninstall and recode their app for them because they cant make a product that works. 0/10 would not recommend.
1,Spotify not as good as used to be. Must cancel the Subscription because of untolerate bug such as search bug lost old playlist and music ads too random.
2,Suddenly my song recommendations are really bad. Every time its playing the same songs. Any song i play autoplay starts with the same song. How to fix this ?
4,Love the library but once you heart a tune they tend to overplay it reducing experience of other tunes.
3,On the average nice. But too slow to boot. Cant stand other other audio interferences.
1,I started to use this app a week ago because its impossible to use youtube with tons of ads. But yesterday in spotify I was listening 3*30 sec ads before I can play music and after 2 melodies another 3*30 unskippable ads. It doesnt worth. I wanted to purchase premium version but no - not when I am a hostage
5,Very upset with the newer update. you can no longer add new songs easily to your library. Now you have to go to the album find the song then hit options and save it from there. I wouldnt be so mad if you could just go to the options section while you were on the song in the playlist; but thats just not the case. Spotify please being back the easy add.
4,The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the ads can get really annoying. I LOVE the app otherwise and use it every single day I highly recommend.
4,Sometimes this application will do something quarky I dont have to completely reset it and download my musical lover again. Otherwise split otherwise its been a lot of fun exploring music Thor in music and bands that I did not existed.
4,Hi uhmm the app was verry good and nice but i dont listen song for days then the app just like have a bug when i pick a song it will play other song that i dont want to listen can you fix it for us
5,Music is the most therapeutic way of me just getting through life. I have had my Spotify membership for years. It is my gift to myself every day. Ill never give up my Spotify!
2,Really annoying. Everytime I open my phone after it being closed Spotify starts playing automatically on speaker. Ive tried everything to get it to stop.
2,Ive stopped using the app. I am sick and tired of the app deciding which songs to play in my playlist. It keeps wanting to play the same songs over and over.
1,Useless! Never used to be this bad! Stops playing in the middle of podcasts and I have to unlock phone go into the app to get it to start playing again and wont play unless the app is left open. How is this with �10 a month. Will be cancelling subscription!
1,Whats app with the sudden change now... i cant even play next song and i cant play the song i want i have to shuffle and i have to shuffle about 6 times so as to find the song i want and i cant repeat it .Now its useless gonna delete this app im going to use Boomplay its better
1,Ever since the last couple of app updates it crashes on me every 10 minutes or so. The playing bar keeps getting stuck on a song or podcast too so I have no clue what Im listening to. When it connects to my truck it creates issues and often my phone will start playing after Ive shut my truck off which it never used to do before. Not impressed. Ive tried redownloading the app and still have the same problems. Considering switching to another music provider.
1,Doesnt play the albums I click on cant view albums properly useless skip limits intrusive ads.
1,Totally rubbish worst music app ever!! I want to listen to an album and keep getting a totally different song randomly pop into what Im listening to(usually Asian) try to skip it(as Im not Asian) and after a few skips it wont let me do any more unless I upgrade to premium Im not upgrading so Ill just delete the app its shockingly rubbish!!
2,whenever i make a playlist spotify just randomly adds songs and i can never restart my playlist and listen to the songs i actually want to listen to
1,Theres no point I had a recent review but I realized I was being too generous the creators are GREEDY Just coming up of ways to FORCE users to buy premium they dont even give you a choice why even make this app free?! The moment I press shuffle on my playlist a Suggested song plays AND I DONT EVEN LIKE IT and the ads aswell I doubt creators are even looking at reviews If I could Ill give this app a -10/100
5,I LOVE THIS APP (I have Spotify premium) and it has made my experience 10 times better just listening to my favourite songs in high res without any interruptions feels like heaven and not to mention this app definitely has 95% of songs on the planet so thats cool I love Spotify wrapped aswell makes me feel special Lol. the ui is top notch! Getting used to audio books on there aswell nowadays its way better than I thought worth it if you arent using the free plan
3,I cant pause or play with my phone locked anymore. The buttons are showing that theyre being pressed but still nothing. Normally wouldnt be a huge deal but since i listen at work it can be a big inconvenience. Otherwise the rating would be much better.
4,It is one of the most popular song app in the world and I like it...but one thing is that if you want to listen to music if you are outside so you cant use it as there need to be a network
2,Offline mode is very glitchy. And its cumbersome to turn off and on. Why no button for it on the homepage rather than having to dig into settings? It must be a much-used function surely given were using our MOBILE phones to use the app roaming around in WiFi-free zones?! Often it doesnt work at all cant find my downloads and I waste minutes fiddling around with the app trying to make it work. Needs a serious rethink.
4,Best app ever! I just gave it -1 because sometimes it dosent have the songs Im looking for when I search it up for example ( Still with you - jungkook))) but yeah after all its a wonderfully app! And the adds are not even that bad to! Good app I recommend it!
4,The only reason for a 4 is because I cant share my liked songs. Everything else is just perfect for me. The recommendations engine and discoverability is the best. But not being able to share my liked songs as a playlist is a bummer.
1,The new update sucks. You cant play any song you want. It was better before until the developers put play any song in premium & now you can only play music using shuffle mode. Please put the play any song back in free rather than on premium. T _ T
1,i have to listen to 3 ads to listen to a minute song... everything u can do in spotify is a premium feature so might aswell pay for everything before downloading this app. worst music app ever u cant listen to ur favorite song without getting interrupted. if i could leave a -5/5 star review i would.
1,Spotify just has too many adds these guys beg for us to buy Spotify premium. Whats wrong with you guys ? Gaana gives us free music and minimal adds. Its my suggestion to the people that DO NOT INSTALL SPOTIFY you will listen to adds rather than music. Its literally an app for ADDs and not for music. These guys even made variations in their advertisments as some days back they were vigourously trolled for their annoying adds. Comeon Spotify stop begging for premium !
5,Absolutely love their customer service. Have had 1 issue with the app but it was resolved in under 15 min. Did not have to wait 24 hrs or longer for a response or help with my issue.
1,Im quite frustrated with this app; lyrics were added to all of my devices with spotify a month ago but it still wont update on my phone!!! :anger: Anyone know how to fix this???
3,Generally good but theres an issue where the file size starts to expand that can only be fixed by uninstalling and reinstalling the app. I listen to Spotify A LOT so it leaves me doing this two to three times a week or having a 3 to 6 GB app. It just gets old.
5,Truly the best music app as it is it really helps me to get to know other artist in the same type of music Im listening at... It also gives updates on new song and really appreciate the app...
5,Good app local file thing is a bit weird to use since sometimes it doesnt save the files but it works for the most part.
4,Great app! Has become an essential part of my life. But there are some smaller problems like the long loding times when opening the app. Or for some months it doesnt show a mini player anymore where you can skip a song even if the phone is locked. Every time you want to skip you have to go in the app. And also if you are in offline mode it has too long of a loading time even for your downloaded songs. If those things are fixed -> easy 5 stars
2,Great app but my only problem is that when I play a song it wont play or itll stop 30 seconds into the songbut the podcasts work well and dont stop. Which is disappointing since I just bought premium. ;-;
3,The new update is pretty cool but THE SCROLL BAR IS GONE I swear please bring it back. Its impossible to scroll down through like 2k+ songs so please
4,Spotify music is cool! Beside you making your own list of favorite songs It makes up special list of your favorite tones I listen to on one play set too in different ways then I have made up
1,Dunno what youve done to this but its unusable. Takes like 10mins to load a song and god forbid you want to skip tracks.
4,I love this app so much and I love almost everything about it! Well exept for PREMIUM its soooo annoing because youve taken away some features of the app like offline listening and unlimited skips so that we have to pay to for what we had already. And I do have proof of the unlimited skips and offline listening because I have an old tablet and it cant be updated so I still have all the features of premium other wise its a BRILLIANT app and I would recommend you to download it :ok_hand:
4,Everything goes great amazing audio quality but when my phone is closed I try to pause songs without opening my phone it wont stop. So Im having to open my phone just to pause my music.
4,Really cool app... It consumes less data and its just amazing one problem is that buy the premium ad always pops up that is sometimes mood spoiler too.. i would love if that pops up really less other wise whole good app..
3,I love Spotify but in the new update i lost the ability to download my songs into my SD card. In a phone where any app should justify their existence due easily you go into low storage terrain being unable to send my downloads into SD card makes me mad. Worse due its a result of an update.
1,It is such an annoying app. You get 2 mins ads after literally every song. Its an overhyped app.
1,Apset my account twice charging my account for 6 months and I did not receive any of the credit back I do not recommend Spotify at all if not speak to a person at all you have to pay for another something me settle any dispute you have with them rip off
2,The only issue i have is that i dont know if my account is bugged or something because i dont have the lyrics mode when i log in with other account works but not with mine i tried all the things that moderators suggest on the web forum but still doesnt work i have the app up to date. Pls help me and help the other people who also have this issue. Ty
4,Spotify is amazing And I know that they want us to get premium But they dont need to play 2 ads after every 2 songs Its annoying They can play it after every 7 songs or so.. Thats all Im saying Other than that the app is amazing :heart_eyes:
5,Amazing! I enjoyed hearing Melanie Martinezs podcasts and music videos here. I LOVE the NEW SPOTIFY UPDATE! :smiling_face_with_hearts: Go DOWNLOAD SPOTIFY FOR FREE NOW!! (I am not a bot but I just want people to notice Spotify. :sweat_smile:)
3,Hi to whom it nay concern Lately the app are not working smoothly cos the song stop after playing and also after a song completed it stops. Need you advise. Thanks.
5,The base quality and audio output is superb . I always consider this app to listen music . From me A+
1,This use to be my favorite app but ever since November 2021 it has completely stopped working on my phone. The app works on other devices but not my new phone. Its to the point that Ive canceled my premium account because the app does not function AT ALL.
4,The only issues are the following: limited skips without premium cant loop songs or play in any order wanted have to have a certain number of songs in Playlist to play it correctly.
1,I used to like it a lot when I put my own songs now they add songs I cant even stand I have not chosen the artist I dont know why they wanted to choose the songs I choose to hear I prefer to choose my own I know what they like far better than they ever will!!!!! I spend more time deleting songs and listening to any!!!:rage:
1,Intrusive and broken. Wont play songs and wouldnt close when ot did just kept playing with app closed. Had to uninstall to stop. Just another case of people making things that dont work yet still getting paid to do so.
4,Great app I just wish they would bring back the option to pick the exact song you want to listen to and not have to wait through a shuffle of other songs but other than that I would say it works amazing and I hope they keep improving the app
2,Was good now I cannot play anything just keeps pausing every second after I hit play never did this before no interpretations during ads but impossible to listen to now Ive cleared cache data and reinstalled nothing helps
4,Well I like it better than any other music streaming apps because it has the most wide range of music from around the world. As I get bored listening songs in known languages.
5,Its the best app to listen to free music from all of your favorite Artists Genres and Podcasts. You can also create your own Playlist with all your favorite music you like and Spotify makes you a Playlist for your entertainment and enjoyment of music you can also listen to 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening or get Spotify Premium that doesnt have any Ads to ruin your music time. So I love Spotify and encourage people to get it it will be your favorite music app of all time Spotify :green_heart: :headphones:
5,Used to use Pandora before Spotify I loved it and didnt mind the ads but Spotify crushes it cant really say much more though It was a good up but Spotify is better.
4,Im back hope things dont change so much poor people or non tech people can still use and enjoy it. app was working great until one day chromcast web player showed up on it. Now if I try to play it my personal play list just plays aprox 1 min and switches songs or plays an album I never chose and dont care for.
1,Let me list all the negatives: - Too many repeat songs - You cant skip more than 6 songs an hour even if theyre repeats - Too many ads and you cant skip them. - You cant rewind songs. - Theres only shuffle play. If you just wanna listen to one album youre out of luck.
5,Everything I want in music! Create my own Playlist listen to a friends Playlist or choose from Spotifys choices... always up to date with the oldest and the newest hot hits! No other platform can compete!
5,Its a really great app understanding price for the premium package mostly on time for new and latest music. :v:
1,App used to work without me having to open It now have to open it everything I connect to my radio headphones anything. Before it would play without having to open my phone and open the app and press play. Trash. Wish someone could help me but nothing. Spend hard earned money to receive no help
1,The app is good but i turned off auto play and i have over 15 songs in my playlist and it wont stop playing suggested songs i even restarted and uninstalled the app and it wont stop playing suggested songs
1,This is a terrible app and would not recommend it!!!!!! First it was going great until I tried to play songs from my playlist but it wouldnt let me all it would play was BILLIE JOEL!!!!!!! I HATE BILLIE JOEL!!!!!!! I WOULD GIVE YOU A ZERO START RATING BUT I CANT!!!!! DONT DOWNLOAD!!!!!
1,The worst design I have ever seen on any application I have ever used. Its literally useless. You type the name of a song in the search bar and click play on the song and a random song from another artist will start playing. You add the song you wanted to hear on an empty playlist and click play and a random song from another artist will start playing. Its literally impossible to listen to what you want. Your app literally only has one job. Incredible levels of incompetence
1,Back then before this new update that encourages (More like forcing) free users to go premium then it wouldve been 5/5. But now forcing users to go shuffle an entire playlist just to get to one song and specific songs only play in preview? A stupid decision. Just gonna switch to another app instead might return to this if the update is reverted.
2,Just a couple weeks ago I was watching YouTube videos with Spotify playing in the background both sounds coming out of the same stereo.Now all of a sudden it stopped working.You guys dont need any more money you have tons of corporate money you dont always have to be in cahoots with each other ruining peoples listening experiences. Spotify is about enhancing that and you guys just ruin it.This is a MAJOR issue a common issue everyone and I mean everyone is complaining about FiX ASAP. trash
5,I use this app everyday and Im enjoying every minute of it but in dark mode I cannot see the play and pause button in the app.
5,Never I Have a new phone without Spotify. I love music and this is the gate to access all of it. Just simply amazing experience
5,I love this app its very easy to use and the great thing I like about it is I can make my own Playlist and access it at anytime its great this app is a keeper and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to find a good app to play music listen to podcasts and even church services are a whole lot more love love love it thank you.
2,I found that Spotify used 9.8% of my battery life since last full charge. The problem is that usage was 100% background usage.. On top of that if you try to limit background usage the app will shut down suddenly or fail to start the next song after one finishes. Spotify for mobile..goodbye. Pandora here I come.
3,It was ok until the new update because I cant listen to one single song without it being in a playlist shuffled and I cant even skip songs anymore. How does that make any sense?!?
1,Paid for premium when I needed a root canal done and wanted ad free music for the procedure. Constant glitches say it was playing one song but be playing another etc. They also charged me another month earlier than scheduled. Decided to see if the free version would be worth glitches and its even worse. Any app that tries to make you pay to skip is a joke. Would start my songs halfway through & not let me start it from the beginning. Ads wouldnt load. Free youtube beats paid spotify anyday.
3,The app is great except the fact that if you dont pay for premium they ruin your listening experience. They play the same songs over and over and over again and they interup you with adds every 5 seconds. I like it but I dont have the money for premium and it really makes me mad to have this happen when all I wanna do is listen to music.
3,Would get a better a review of not for their casting issues. Casting video seems to work for about 10 seconds then buffers for infinity however casting my screen works just fine.
2,Remove behind the lyrics its pointless since you dont show anything besides the chorus and spends the rest of the time telling you things you really didnt gife af about and accessing the lyrics requires you to swipe up which interferes with swiping to the side to change a song which is far more important no one cares that kurt cobain had a ceasar sald before he released heart shaped box its irrelevant to what your users want to listen to the damn music
4,I would rate it 5 stars but there is no reason to have to have Spotify premium just to go to your Playlist and pick any song that you want. If Spotify would fix it and make it to where if you go to your Playlist you could pick a song. Also I dont want you to add songs to my Playlist I already did that. Fix it please.
4,Music good. Podcasts can be good - but the half listened to section has not been working for me recently.
2,Spotify itself great. Good music high quality no problem there. But the app is horrible. So buggy takes forever to load sometimes it doesnt load at all. Now this might not be a lot but recently it has gotten too much and I am seriously thinking about switching to a provider with a stable app. Its a joke:-1:
1,Spotify is so weird It wont let me play songs that I wanna play but different songs I dont know play instead. This app needs to get fixed for those including me without premium.
1,Brilliant service when it works. But the most basic things are still not working. Why do downloaded podcasts not play when in offline mode? The only suggested solutions are reinstall the app and redownload everything. This isnt an option when youre traveling and without data or WiFi which is the specific reason why I downloaded all of the podcast episodes in the first place. Not good enough for a premium service.
4,I use this quite frequently esp being I love multiple genres however My daily made for you lists keep switching on me when im listening to them. Its annoying cuz when I want rap or hip hop or newer rap it changes to industrial when I want black metal it switches to doom. If theres a way to better compartmentalize my different tastes with out switching it up on me thatd be great. At least switch the artists up with in simular genres or artist and not totally shift into a different spectrum.
4,I decided to use spotify to stream music because my music files are bulking up my phone memory and I usually stream when outside where there is no wifi and I just use my mobile data but for the life of me I cant get this thing to work on mobile data its always offline i checked all the app permissions logged in logged out cleared cache uninstalled reinstalled I just cant get it to work. On wifi it works just fine. What happened?!
1,This app always freezes takes forever to load/skip songs and always plays Heat of the moment by Asia. Its a very bad app
1,The layout and the player is good but way too many ads. Like a ridiculus amount of adsssssssss.
3,its really great for creating playlistsblends discovering new artists etc but the frequency of ads is quite a lot.
1,If youre on Android this app wont let you play any songs from your phone. Only the chorus and thats it. Its impossible to get any songs to play on your phone unless you play something from another device.
1,Everytime Im listening to my playlist it plays something that I is not on my playlist and if i try to skip more than 6 songs it says I cant.
5,Very happy with the services i have too many options here even spotify gave a 3 months free subscription...great deal...thank you spotify...
3,1. I see irrelevant playlists about Bhangra Tollywood etc. despite having English as my only preferred language. 2. I see irrelevant podcasts on my homepage in Hindi despite again my language preferences. The language preference setting just feels like an illusion of choice. Overall not an experience I expect from a premium service.
2,I cant even PLAY MY MUSIC IN PIECE AND IN ORDER?!?! LIKE WHAT!! I DID love the app until the update happened but I do understand why the ads and all that but like SHUFFLING IT SO I CAN LISTEN TO MUSIC LIKE WHAT THE I WOULD LIKE THE ORDER BACK BUT COME ON! All I am saying is that can the shuffling the music around stop thats all okay?
4,Its amazing but the watching an ad for 30 minutes ad free doesnt work I always get an ad a few songs later. Also I think their should be a setting where you can put an equalizer mode so songs play and it shows the equalizer for the song other than that its amazing.
5,I really love Spotify a lot. Like most apps though you have a limit for songs you can skip. I love how small artists can post there music and content and its really cool when you can send friends your playlist.
1,Awful app i prescribe the users not to Install it it is full of ads. You can download other apps like resso it is somewhat better than this. So please dont Download it is the waste of your data.
3,Spotify has a bug in Spotify-Connect feature for Samsung multiroom speakers in its recent update (8.6.94.422). When I use Spotify 8.6.94.306 (prev version) Spotify works well with Samsung speakers. But with the most recent build it no longer finds Samsung speakers. Could you fix Spotify-Connect for Samsung multiroom speakers?
4,App is good but all songs are still not available. it shows this songs are not available in your region. hope they solve this :slightly_smiling: 3 stars for now
4,One day I was listening to music and could not listen to songs I love only the suggestion ones witch I thought werent good! I tried to listen to the ones I love in every way! Its no good. The only way is to get premium witch cost money. Im not spending money to listen to songs. Im sorry Spotify its a good app but I cant use it. :pleading_face: But still I will give it a good rating because either way its a good app!
2,I really like this app but when i have shuffle on that means i want it to shuffle all the songs not listen to 10 out of 967 songs over and over again. Please fix this.
5,Excellent music app I enjoy it tons! It is possible to listen many artists and their best songs. Highly recommend it for me the best music app experience.
5,Team Spotify thanks much for a wonderful music ecosystem. A feature request can you provide importing playlist and offline songs from Wynk I really struggling to that! Thanks much!!
1,I know that not everything is free but I dont think its fair that web version/ desktop versions of the app allows me to listen to more music than the mobile version and you get to see what songs are in every playlist.
3,Rewind and fast-forward buttons on lock screen are still greyed out. Same annoying problem for months for so many Samsung users.
4,Please add the feature of exclusion the tracks from the downloaded album. Also when Im on the lyrics mode I want to read lyrics to the next track as well. Let the lyrics window be open unless I want to close it its inconvenient to open them every track.
2,Suddenly it doesnt find devices to cast/connect to so this defies the point of this app for me. For fact - other apps find wifi speakers(google) and work great but spotify finds only tv annoying
1,Reducing to 3 stars as downloading songs doesnt seem to make a difference either slow to load or simply dont load when my connection is low or disconnected. EDIT: Reduced straight to 1 star! Since latest update I cannot play songs on Spotify u less I have the app open which is pretty useless tbh. It wasnt fixed after 2 weeks so I cancelled my subscription and now it seems that i cant listen to any music just ads ads and more ads! Deleted!! Ill just use YouTube premium instead thanks.
5,Its a good music app and it has most of the music thar I have. Spotify also has it so you can listen to gaming videos(well idk if thats actually a thing Im just trying to help out the app) the app is great.
5,Fabulous music application. The best music application for music lovers. Absolutely great work #Spotify. Keep up always your high standards and quality music for your customers. I am proud of using Spotify application for listening music now and forever :notes:
1,Very very bad app doesnt let you listen the song you want to you have to play the whole Playlist and there are soo many ads. THIS IS VERY BAD APP DONT DONWLOAD
1,I dont like the songs you added to MY PLAYLISTS. Enjoy your extra chromosomes on your own because you lost a user. Stop forcing me to listen to songs that I dont like I hope all of you stub your toes and it gets infected and amputated and you constantly fall down stairs because of it
4,I love Spotify but I am having trouble with the app and it not playing through my speaker properly. It stops at random times and its a little hard to work out why.
1,Love the algorithms the team uses for finding new music. But the persistent unloading of any of the librarys or liked songs or even any content for that matter on an android every hour or less is ridiculous. Makes me want to cancel subscription before the 3months is over. Fix this. And I shall change to 5 star.
2,I can bear with the ads but please add the lyrics feature to the app :sob: Its been two months since I wrote this so when are we getting the lyrics Lol you guys keep releasing updates for an app that does the bare minimum! and doesnt even have the lyrics feature worldwide yet
4,I love this app and the daily mix of songs it makes for me. Only 1 flaw it plays in the background non-stop killing my battery. I have to force stop it when Im done playing music. I tried logging out of the app but that doesnt stop it from being on stand-by in the background.
1,Shuffle Is Horrible Im not sure when they changed the algorithms but its so painful to use Spotify for liked songs now. I have a 500 song playlist. I want to listen on shuffle. I dont understand why it doesnt randomize the 500 songs. Instead it just randomizes one. You are very likely to hear the same songs on shuffle before hearing unheard ones. PLEASE SPOTIFY BRING BACK TRUE SHUFFLE MODE.
4,Its a really good app for overall I have to get a four stars because I didnt use it for about a month and it reset my account which is not something Im a fan of because it erased all of my search history and I can never remember my search history its just ridiculous that it reset my entire account I had to go in and then you create another password just because I didnt use it for a month it was just so ridiculous and it was like a lengthy process too I got really sick and tired of it. :)))
2,ok Spotify premium is awesome but- when you get off of premium you cant even choose your own songs to listen to. you have to listen to it on *shuffle.* dumb reason to get mad but this pissed me right off. what the hell? lemme choose what song *i* wanna listen to. update : now it keeps crashing and im on premium.
1,Im confused... Whatever I do I cant listen to any of the songs I want to I can see them I hit play and for some reason some other song that has no similarities starts playing. I feel made fin off!
1,Your latest update really sucks.. the app run so slow and it hangs.. been a premium user for a year. The more you update the more the app gets laggy. Changing soon to a better app.
1,So far I been using Spotify it been a great app but there are some issues starting to appear I cant seem to listen and enjoy my playlist without having it pause by itself every one min or so keep doing so on many of my devices really disappointed really hope it could be fix soon.
3,Its a really good app to play music/podcasts but I dont really like how much it changed and how more aggressive it is to non-premuim users. Non-premium users are beaten to the point where all they can do is only shuffle. I didnt have premium for a day and I felt like I got pushed off a roof. PC and Console players that use spotify without premium arent as punished as non premium mobile players.
4,Really good app. Almost covers each and every song this planet has ever heard. Only thing that bugs me is multiple advertisements. Its ok to have one advertisement in between. But sometimes they make us hear 2-3 advertisements in a row. XO
2,The ads on this app are absurd I probably spend most of my time listening to ads rather than music and/or podcasts. Is there even a point in using free Spotify? You have to get past like 4 ads to listen to a song. Should I use YouTube over this wretched app? Yep Im comparing you to YouTube its enough ads! And you guys are going to ignore other people with criticism here aswell? This is pathetic and money hungry. Smh
1,Autoplay is not working. When i search for a song after it was played it just stop it didnt play with similar songs or show the list of similar songs like it used to meehhh for me
3,Very beautiful playlist... But the strategy of advertisement is irritating. I understand you want us to get premium but its not needed to advertise after each and every song. Please stop it.
5,I gotta love it! its the best music app you could ever have you can even play podcasts and make playlists!!
1,After I log or sign in even after I make 100 different accounts when I add songs it shows a list of the artists at the top of my playlists and wont show me the songs and when I tap on my songs it only plays a few seconds of one part I dont recommend this app anymore started of well and ended like a dump
1,The more I use it the worse it gets. It used to be ok but now Im forced to listen to 3 adds in a row every 2 songs I listen. and as if that wasnt enough when we go to an artist account to listen to a specific album we are forced to listen to every other track from every other album the artist has. this is really annoying since Spotify is the only place i can listen to a new album when it is released but because this happens I cant even listen to the whole thing. please do better.
5,Best app ever! Works smoothly easy to use and it has a friendly interface.
2,Yeah there are songs but after 2 songs there is always an ad 30 seconds long idk if u want to listen more to ads than actual music then go ahead.
5,Brilliant facility to change your playlist to fit your mood with no adverts interrupting your listening. Absolutely massive catalogue of tracks and artists. Highly recommended you wont be disappointed :heart:?
2,It is not getting much ads from others yet it is forcing itself to take the premium version. This only spoils its fame. My friend has premium version. Even on that the compilation of songs is incomplete. Many of the famous albums are missing on it.
4,Its been 2 yrs since I am using Spotify  and yah I am loving it. I like every thing about Spotify just one thing that always bugs me is  those ads . I would just request Spotify to lessen them . Thats it . It gives Podcasts hell a lot of Music  customized playlist  daily playlist and much much more . What do u need more than this huh?!:relieved::relieved:
3,It use so much battery this app which doesnt make sense for a music player app. The app is full of random bugs for example if you try to play a song it might not work and you need to click it again it happens very rarely though.
5,Its a privelege to have this masterful creation soothing to my anxiety with great selection of beautiful creations flowing through my ears and creating inspiration and productivity through my days. THANK YOU folks for not being so stuck on ads and opening up a new world of bliss in my chaotic yet blessed life. You have a wonderful application here and options and ideas for playlists are endless. Would be great to work for this company if I could. Maybe my Muzika will be here one day ; ].
4,Its just what I always wanted but I am just not yet sure how I access podcasts and maybe also if they could store our downloaded music on a cloud kind if storage as it really takes up much phone space depending on the storage and songs one has downloaded! Otherwise keep it up Spotify team!
2,I like the app its good my problem is i hate it when i play my favorites which is i cant because they PLAY FIRST the songs i didnt mark favorite on it (excuse my grammar) please dont do that what i marked is what i listen not what you want play on my device!!!!
5,When I need to listen to what I like to hear its all so much easier with Spotify I enjoy my music with Spotify thank you for just been here when I need it Spotify is wonderful. Your true listener Teresa
1,This app is so bad I been reinstall it more than 9 time but my music is still not playing it only show me to choose my music taste .and only playing adds not the music
3,I absolutely love this app. The reason why I gave it 3 stars is cause the ads are just too annoying. Would give 5 stars if ads are limited
5,I enjoy the way theymake up lists for me. They are quite accurate in what they choose. I am an elderly person and like 40s popular and classical music and they pick out music that i didnt know about. It is well worth having.
3,Beggar APP Irritating Ads Just For Premium. How many times does an app have to beg the customers to get preminum by posting ads just for spotify premium..I thought spotify for an International and well reputed app that doesnt need gimicks for people to use it. Great app..love the music BUT the fact that the ads Only ASk to join Premium every 5 bloody mins may infact discourage me from buying Premium.
1,Used to work fine now it glitches every time I use the podcasts. It gets stuck on a previously viewed one until I uninstall and reinstall it. It wont show the visuals anymore for the video podcasts when linked to my Bluetooth even tho its not on background.
3,To be honest its a really good music app but the thing is I cant choose my own songs or go through playlist and its really annoying.When I try to choose a song it goes to a playlist and I have to shuffle I go to songs and it still doesnt let me choose the specific song I want to listen to. Another thing is theres no lyrics. When I go to songs with lyrics no lyrics shows up.
3,Tried the app again after a long time off it and what a change. The lyrics functionality is now present and the app is no longer buggy and slow. I still dont understand why we have to deal with podcasts though. New artist recommendation deserves a bigger spotlight (front and centre). Tour dates and merch is harder to find now. How about artist interviews and SM built in. Listening parties is still a mission. At this point its just okay and barely competes with the other services. Music first.
3,So if you dont have premium you cant play the song you want to when you want to you just have to wait for it to go through your playlist  it plays your playlist random order it plays songs in YOUR playlist which should be full of YOUR selection with random songs they THINK you would like you only get 6 skips per hour it gives you up to 5 ads in a row every 6 or so songs you cant loop you also cant rewind so if you dont have income to pay for premium just go to Pandora.
4,Live this app. But the problem is ads. The ads are constantly telling us to get premium. The worse thing is that now i get 2 ads instead of one and maybe even 3!!! This is too much
5,I love Spotify because my musical taste is rather eclectic and I can find it all on Spotify from Gregorian chant to folk to modern pop music. I am truly amazed! I also lsten to several podcasts and I can listen to them on Spotify too. My kids talked me into it and I am so glad that I have the app!
5,Spotify has fantastic music collections. Excellent music quality. I was recently introduced to this app by a friend of mine & Im so in love with it.
2,Terrible inconsistent app. Often becomes unusable with incorrect songs showing while playing something new. Just a poor user experience for android.
3,Its a good platform for music and podcasts if it loads I have to close and reopen the app multiple times just to listen to music and if Im not in the app for a bit and try to go back I have to do it again
2,App was good but The song stops again and again and we have to go in app and play it again from starting. It is just so irritating. Pls fix the issue :pray::pray:
1,I couldnt log in my account. It always say that Im currently set to offline and go online to connect to spotify. Then it sends an email for me to click but it always says that the link is expired and send a new one even though it is a new one and is supposed to expire 4hrs after it has been sent.
5,Awesome selection of music. Good family plans and not many adds when you go without premium. Listening for awhile had no problems.
5,While I actually prefer the Deezer app in most aspects Deezer doesnt have a decent Ella Fitzgerald collection which is obviously COMPLETELY unacceptable. So Im back to Spotify. At least they know what good music is.
5,Thank you for being ethical and considerate of your users. I like the app coz the commercials are noninvasive like YouTube. Plus the interface is nicely designed and suggestions are very relevant. Highly recommended :+1: Keep up the good job
5,Would like to be able to skip the songs on my playlists though shouldnt have to join the premium Spotify just to do that.Plus too many ads.
5,Awesome :100: experience . Music is everything great and then some. Best out there hands down for a music app.
2,It used to work fine now the interaction with car infotainment systems is wonky. If displays the info on the first song you play and doesnt change no matter what youre playing. I was worried it was my BMW so I connected it to my boyfriends Audi different manufacturer different everything and the issue was there too. Its been over a month cant you guys look into it already?
1,I have installed spotify but it isnt playing any song this is the worst experience I am having with spotify . Only playlists are showing up not they wont open up nor I can play any song by search ..please fix this problem as soon as possible because I am missing music
5,I love the app. Awesome. But I know there are some people who like to use light mode so I was wondering if you could add light mode so that people who like to use it can use it on Spotify too!
5,Awesome selection and matching the types of music and artist definitely my go-to for music. Must have for the music aficionados.
1,I CANNOT ADD IMAGES TO MY PLAYLIST ITS KEEPS SAYING TRY AGAIN EVEN MY INTERNET IS STABLE. It have so many bugs now it keeps playing 1 song on repeat even u didnt open the repeat. Completely useless on offline mode even my account is premium like u literally cant do some things like adding queue of that song it was also so slow to load a music.
1,Im sharing a collaborative playlist with my girlfriend. But there is no option to use it only for us two. Consequently random dudes put their stupid songs in the playlist. What the hell is wrong with you Spotify? Couldnt you see this coming? Give us an option to make collaborative playlists private.
5,Great service you can find almost every song youre looking for on here but there are some exceptions like I am unable to find songs of various artists like Echoes by Pink Floyd and so.
2,Loved starting off on premium but then when I switched Back to free it wouldnt let me keep any of my download added songs n playlists. Super bummed n disappointed :disappointed:
3,Ok. App is great. Making Playlists is super easy and UI is easy to navigate. Its how music apps should be simple and lets me listen. But its gotten really annoying lately. I dont have premium. It barely gives me any of those ads that allow me to listen for 30 minutes uninterrupted anymore and when it does it plays an ad right after the 1st song. & It keeps adding songs to my Playlist that you cannot remove. And why are the ads so loud? Scares the snot out of me. Totally kills the vibe
2,the ads completely ruin it for me. its not all that easy to use either. much easier on pc. if im desperate i would use spotify on mobile but i would much rather just go to youtube.
2,Im okay with ads and this app was fine until a few days ago. It updated made some changes and its a bunch of playlist where Im not even going to get my specific songs that I wanted to listen and this point I feel like YouTube music is better than at least I dont to shuffle the playlist all day long. What kind changes are you doing? I just want a specific song. Not the whole playlist where I have to go find it for 2-3 days it took me to find a week just to findasongnamelalala(I hadtoshort it)
1,Not happy. Ive used Spotify for over 3 years now and loved it everyday but these last 6 months with the last 3 updates witch you have to keep doing or the app will stop on you and you have to close it and start again heaps. So now the shuffle on your own play list plays the same songs over and over daily like a radio station witch Ive gotten over and found other ways around this. But now making us play more too keep our off-line use is absolute bs its it this plan now so you cant do this!!
3,I like that you can make a Playlist but I hate that you have to watch adds. I had to watch 4 ads in a row and I was frustrated
1,Terrible music recommendations. Horrible interface. It consistently selects 50 awful songs for my daily mix. I dont think it could be this bad if it was just a random selection. It is actively bad.
5,Great cheap price. Also got bundled in with Hulu for free. The latest on all the music can find just about anything you want. Podcast for giveaways exclusive sweepstakes definitely at my highly recommend it
4,They are still missing certain songs. Especially if you like the remixed version. Searching for songs can be a pain sometimes. I wish they had a search by lyrics option.
1,Updates that others have doesnt seem to be applied to all... Like where are my lyrics also downloaded music doesnt always play with no internet
5,Great mobile app its my preferred listening app. I enjoy being able to make playlists. I just wish it loaded faster and allowed for listening on my computer.
2,unless you get Spotify premium (which isnt cheap) it is pretty much terrible. you can only shuffle albums that include the songs you want you cant skip songs more than 6 times per hour. and THE ADVERTS. they are every minute with up to 5 in a row! to summarise the app really really wants you to purchase one of the premium packages and it shows.
4,Spotify is great for listening to all sorts of music! My only problem is that it cost 10 dollars a month for premium.
4,Good for music discovery. Doesnt allow hiding of podcasts so if youre a 18-34 male you will have to live with seeing joe rogans face presented to you dozens of times per day.
3,Im a premium user have been for years. Was a great app until a recent update where its gone to poo. I find myself cursing this app now. Im still using it as it does work and will continue my subscription. BUT if you cancel Joe Rogan (I dont listen to him btw) I will cancel my subscription.
2,The widget goes blank after a few hours of not using Spotify Pixel 5 Android 12 quite annoying. Podcasts need a feature to auto download when a new episode comes out.
2,Spotify is good and all but you cant skip ads and they just throw ads after a few songs. When the ads pop up it NEVER ENDS. Too many ads. Im dying and seeing an ad is HELL. Please fix this.
3,My favorite music app but since the latest update my music will stop playing at random. Even if its the only app Im using. I have to open the app and restart the song from the beginning. It wont start again from the widget. No problems until this.
4,I really enjoy a personalized oriented playlist i can put ALL the songs i enjoy into. Need more artists on this. I run programs everyday! LOVING IT! 5 stars for more 90/2000s music :wink::superhero:
5,Longtime user. Started using Spotify in 2008 before the laws allowed use in the USA. Imn so here. Enough for you? Free is great too but Im paying premium. Very strong. Waiting for HD to start.
1,It used to be my favorite app to listen to music but when you got your new update i click on a song i want but then it starts playing a completely different song when i go to my likes my suffle play doesnt work and i cant click on the song i want it just gives me a a 10 second preview of the chores and then stops
1,Keeps saying internet connection is not available even though Im sitting right next to the router and is able to use every other application. Such an overrated app! Im sticking to my included Prime Music. Would give less than 1 star if possible
2,Constantly stops playing. Not an ideal app for someone who cant have their phone in their hands non-stop to be able to restart every song.
5,Absolutely Love Spotify!!!!!! With premium I download my music and am able to listen when I have no internet signal!!! Yall should give it a try you wont be let down!!
5,I do heavily enjoy Spotify - The fact of free music being available is nice and the ads are do able. I do own Spotify premium as I do like the app and think it deserves that money And also dont really like ads. But these ones are fine. Recommended 8.5/10
5,This app is the best but it should start playing another song after the one is finished which we searched for. It should not just stop.
3,Doesnt have some songs at all. Should have a tab that lists every song by an artist rather than greatest hits and then discography. Also app just quits casting randomly despite strong connection. The feedback below has helped me make a decision on if I want to continue to PAY for thsi service next month when the free sub runs out. Ummm NO.
2,I used to love this app but since the update Ive had to uninstall n reinstall it about 3 times because it keeps freezing up.. i pay for the service and id love for it to stop freezing on me.
2,I like Spotify and all but fix your shuffle program. If I have 100 songs on a play list and hit shuffle. I dont want it to shuffle just 30 of those songs I want it to shuffle all of them. Getting irritating hearing the same songs being shuffled all day
5,I have been using spotify since waay back then and spotify is really such a great app to listen to music i never had any problems with this application and i love this so much
5,Way more music than you could listen to. They have plenty of obscure stuff I cant find elsewhere. I have been premium for 4 years straight. They started givingHulu for free which saved me 10 bucks a month. They even sent me a free Google home mini.
5,Love Spotify. Has all my music still feel the same I just wish I didnt have to watch as many commercials oh well.
5,You can find any song from any artist well if theyre on spotify of course youll be able to find them. The app is great for custom playlists and personal features to custom your listening experience. Highly recommended.
4,Tricky to listen to albums (if downloaded) when offline but thats the only reason it isnt a 5-star review from me because otherwise its excellent!
4,Wonderful app and great selection. The Discover Weekly Playlist always has great new content introducing me to new artists. However I wish there was a way to categorize artists I follow so I can easily play songs from new (to me) artists.
2,This is an ok app but it lacks features that you can get on the PC version like the ability to play a certain song or repeat a song.
5,They keep updating and seem to understand the customers needs. There is so much more to hear in their use of radio stations and I can discover new and forgotten sounds. The linking to speakers is so easy. More than Amazons own app!! And that is when using echos
4,I am a paying customer and I am using Spotify since 1 and a half year  I loved it but unfortunately you have removed some songs like zara zara What I just want to say is please add those songs back (especially zara zara) if you can . I love SPOTIFY
5,I love this I can listen to music in school and add a que whenever I want to listen to certain music one after another.
1,Worst song app ever regret downloading it there are some songs which are good I add them to the playlist and next day it forcefully removed from my plalist and I find the song but a lot of adds come and I cant play the song One more thing dont ever take premium it cancelles adds but it makes the app much bad and worse Who so ever decided to make this app is a monster this just pure hatered coming out from my heart lot of adds and its really annoying iam switching to other song app worst app
3,Easy to use but wont allow me to change songs or pause anymore on my lock screen since that last update.
1,The constant updates are ridiculous. They never fix anything just add usless features and move bottons around. Its incredibly frustrating. I just want to listen to me music. Seriously just make the app work and leave it alone.
5,Great App even without premium. I dont mind not being able to choose the exact song i want i just made playlists for the right mood being able to hear my favorite artists in the background even while my screen is turned off or Im in other tabs is what i searched for Thank you for developing this app!
2,Listening to podcasts on here is driving me nuts. I only downloaded spotify to listen to JRE. If Im listening to a podcast and out my screen to sleep the podcast eventually will freeze and no longer play. The podcast player often gets stuck on past episodes title/artwork but is playing a different pidcast and the timestamp freezes so i dont know where I am in the episode.
5,Love Spotify and the rotating music content I find on here. The adds need a little work but overall a great music app.
2,While the recommendations work great the app desparately needs the following features (basic stuff really) IMO 1. ArtistS composers albums and songs category/tabs in library 2. Option to select individual tracks to download instead of whole playlist/album.
5,Great app for listening music not much ads but I personaly dont like that on some playlists you can change just six songs per hour
3,I love spotify but i dont like the fact that to play my playlist i need to shuffle it. I also cant go back so i cant play the song before which is weird. The liked playlist is a one song play now because eveeytime i listen to something it doesnt play the next song. And it shows the name of the song and artist it doesnt show the albam cover anymore which is also weird. Im not sure if its only because im a new user to spotify its doing that but that gave me one reason to uninstall spotify.
3,Randomly will stop playing music. Takes forever to upload and start playing music. I like the wide variety of songs so I keep paying the 9.99.
4,Really good app for downloading and listening to your favourite music. The adverts are pretty annoying but you have to pay to get rid of them so adverts it is!
1,Ive had to uninstall and reinstall this app twice because theres no support team just a troubleshooting page so when the app seriously messes up theres literally nothing else I can do. Im about to start looking into other music playing apps because theres no way im paying for a subscription to something this buggy.
2,It was perfectly fine until the last update. Ill click on a song and itll shuffle to something completely different?? And I cant click on a song I want to listen to before I shuffle my playlist Istg im just going back to youtube to listen to music
3,Guys Ive never downloaded this yet but just by reading the comments it seems bad but if u dont find Spotify appealing then just use YouTube music its good Ive been using that and especially for ages 10-over will like it Im 14 so I would like a good app to listen to music on. Bye!
5,I really love Spotify really great app. Ive been using for several years now and its still a very good for app downloading and sharing especially the free version..
1,Its a humble request to Spotify please fix my glitch as soon as possible because when ever I play the song I minimise the app but after minimising the song stops Thankyou . This is my other G-mail account
5,Still the best streaming app for music  but only if you got the premium version . Add recommendations in Spotify is the worst among all other apps .
5,If I had words to explain i wish I had more than 500 characters to describe how I feel about this app. Music is my life and I want to make Spotify 100% most used app of my 2022. Every update keeps getting better and getting more and more music thats not out there. Great app
1,Auto plays every time Bluetooth is connected takes over alarm clock ring. Extremely presumptuous to assume I want that all to happen without me telling it to do that. Uninstalled this app sucks Ill never use it again
4,I liked this app but I gave 4 stars because I am just getting startedI am really appreciated that Spotify has very less ad the best thing the sounds are very clear...and actually I am a music lover I love to sing and listen song :headphones::headphones::microphone::microphone::notes::notes: so that so also a reason I loved this app and it has all the songs like Hindi EnglishKorean etc...... tried many apps and this app is the best among those:heart_eyes::heart_eyes:
1,I thought I struck gold moving over from YT... until the trial I didnt know about ended - I cant even select a song anymore! Im not averse to paying (I was formerly a YT premium member) - but looking at your offering for non-paid why the hell would anyone want to use this?! Your ads are even worse here!
1,Is this supposed to be some kind of scam now? For some reason Spotify is removing the individual plan and wants to me use the duos plan. Why would I want to do that? Its just me so why should I pay extra for something I already have?
4,The new update was a bit confusing. I always check for cache in order to free some space but the new updated version put the remove all downloads option in clear cache space amd with that i always ended up removing my downloaded tracks. I always go back to downloading all my playlist all over again. Can you please make it more noticeable or put options to double check what were clicking?thanks
1,Worst music app ever. Just doesnt work properly. Too many technical glitches. Shameless company should spend money on improving the technology / fixing issues before spending on advertising. Complete waste of money.
5,I love Spotify. I have been using it since 2012 and its still the best music streaming app available. The free version is amazing and isnt junked up with a ton of ads. I usually pay for the premium service but money is tight right now so I was expecting to be disappointed but I am thrilled. Ty for being awesome!!:two_hearts::two_hearts::star::star::star::star::star:
2,The app is recommending me to add songs that I already have in my playlist. That never happened before. Its a useful tool to discover new songs based on my playlist but now is useless. It dont even recognize that the song is already added if I press the + button.
1,The app overall is great fantastic... But the only thing I hate is ... That from last few days the amount of Ads i am getting is tooooo much .... Its like after every song i was getting an ad .... Tooo much irritating
5,Best music app ever . Music lovers should go for this one . So many ausom features in it . Very Very great experience till today and will have so on. Loving to use this app.
5,This is a superb app with premium no other music app can match its interface. Tho Spotify India must reduce the premium monthly cost to 99? per month. Tho if it is 119? it is still good bang for buck. I love the premium you may like it too.
3,Song metadata does not transfer onto car display when playing music through Bluetooth meaning as album plays song titles dont update just stay on the first song played. No solution to find online or on Spotify forums just a generic we are looking into this response. Used to be a good app but now considering unsubscribing.
5,Its an amazing app all the songs you want to listen are a click distance.
1,Trash. Sorry if this offended you but like youve made this app a full pay-to-listen app. I MEAN WE CANT EVEN CHOOSE THE SONG WE WANT TO HEAR WE GOT TO LISTEN TO THE WHOLE PLAYLIST TO FINALLY HEAR THE SONG YOUR LOOKING FOR. What is even the point of this? I would rather use youtube. I am sure many can relate... I am disappointed Spotify very disappointed... -
1,bruh why it gotta be so complicated to choose a single song to put in a playlist. no i dont wanna like all the songs in the entire radio??? just let me pick the single????
4,I downloaded this app only for BTS. So its pretty good but please dont give a lot of adds. Atleast change the adds. Its getting on my nerve. It makes me not to use the app. But since I love BTS I use this app alot.
1,Ads every time I play a song. I cant play some songs. I advice you to get a cracked version of spotify on happy mod for free. If youre not a premium user youll wont be able to access much.
4,Great song database but free plan offers nothing (when you compare it to YouTube Music free plan). I love that the lyrics feature is finally here!
3,I listened 3 songs then 3 ads ....again 3 songs then 3 ads ..if premiums arent overpriced i would have bought it.... Before it was only 1 ad i was loving it then ....now its kinda annoying with 3 ads
5,Awesome gospel songs. Good selection process of genre no buffering just as good as playing the cds directly uninterupted. Great app!!
1,It wont connect on my Xbox. I downloaded the app on the Xbox and I tried plugging in the headset and it wouldnt connect. The games and everything works except for Spotify please fix this.
2,I loved using Spotify in the past but now you cant go more than 2/3 songs before you get smacked in the face with ads and I never get the watch this short ad for 30 minutes of no ads� anymore Im to the point of going back to cds Spotify on computer is amazing on phone is garbage
3,Generally an okay app. I have premium and keep experiencing connection issues when trying to cast onto my playstation. Not sure if its a problem associated with the new update.
3,Its really good but one thing I cant feel so good that there is no proper new release on the top of all list where I find what is new.One new release for me catagory is here but it is not so perfect allways.I cant find some frequently release songs.So I have to find them by searching them.Why I always have to do this?..............
1,Without subscription you cant listen even any three songs without adds. After every two three songs they show there adds of 1 minute not even 30 second they will take your complete 1 minutes after every two-three songs.
1,Untill last update it was awesome. But new update is too bad. They made it complex for the sake of design. Its too difficult to navigate between songs while searching
5,One of the best music streaming platforms in the world. Its algorithm is capable of giving you a playlist tht fits your taste nonstop
1,Bruh worst experience ever I cant even listen to a song that I want to listen to without it playing some random other music because its automatically shuffled and I cant even keep it on loop since their isnt a button for that.
5,Got this free for 3 months but am definitely getting the paid version after. I love my gospel music and I have all the songs and genre of music that I like and I love the playlist Spotify builds for me :smiley:
1,Unpleasant. Ugly clunky interface that makes podcasts management and playback difficult.
1,Used to work great but recently when I tried to play a single song on loop it would play many other songs too. Also they are adding random songs to my Playlist that I cant get rid of.
1,Is it necessary to show ads after every 2-3 songs every single time. And not just one they show 3 ads continuously.
5,Freakin love it!!!:heart:?:orange_heart::yellow_heart::green_heart::blue_heart::purple_heart: It has ALL my favorite music and MORE! Always clear never buffers or lags no annoying ads and it continues to play while I access other apps on my device!!
5,Spotify especially if youre a student can work great with your time and if you choose to study Spotify has a wonderful selection of playlists and even though this sounds scripted Im not full of bs this app is great because you even get a Spotify/Hulu deal which is a great bonus. If you are a student I highly recommend this app and if youre not a student I still recommend this app.
5,Everything is great I love this app but to critique it things would be improved by having a history of songs recently played. Another good feature would be being able to see which liked songs are in your playlists without having to individually go through each song in a lengthy process
5,Great quality they have all the podcast and music you will need. You can make playlists and its much better than using a radio even though spotify can be used as a radio. Not too many ads either but your playlist will be interrupted every 15 - 20 song so spotify can stay free.
2,It has a good selection of music but it just adds like 20 songs to my Playlist that I didnt add and then I cant even skip them
1,If you have a Samsung DO NOT download. The app is constantly crashing and stalling. It will more often than not show the wrong song/podcast playing so you dont have the ability to skip forward or know what track youre listening to. Ive tried deleting and re-downloading the app over 5 times and I am a paying customer. NOT IMPRESSED plan on switching to a competitor as soon as my subscription expires.
1,Spotify allows the spread of misinformation. They pay podcasters that are notorious for disseminating inaccurate and outright false news. In addition premium subscribers are subject to watching ads while streaming podcasts.
5,Go to app for music. Easy to find new music easy to find music you love easy to make play lists. I do wish they would bring back the cadence running feature though. That was pretty cool...
5,Being a music lover at young age I was able to listen to all the music I grew up with all the music that as far I can remember them. The era of my teenage years the 80s (all the genre specially new wave) 90s alternative rock grunge the hair bands and until now. Music is everything to me. Music is my life Spotify is life :notes::headphones::horns_sign::+1::sunglasses:
5,I love it. I always listen to music on a daily basis. Spotify is the app I recommend for music folks like me.
4,Its very good its just that you guys removed the feature were we can see the songs and now we can only see the names and I hate how the shuffle button is with like the play button I am not saying its bad but I would like it to be back its fine if not since its not that big of a Problem
1,When I want to play a specific song it wont play instead it will start to play other random songs and say that u need to pay for premium on order to listen to the music I want
5,Never any problems..always really good songs very easy to use the app..thanks Spotify for making lists from different artists and bands just from the music I listen to when I open your app new songs are waiting for me from you :smiling_face_with_hearts:
5,I dont think I would like driving exercising working or cooking as much as I do if I didnt have Spotify to play music or podcasts in the background! Ten years of being on it - still my favorite app.
4,This is a really amazing app and i recommend it highly. But can you please make liked songs so that we can share it like I have many liked songs and i cant share them please and the ads are too much I know we can take premium but not everyone can effort it if you can not remove them please atleast decrease them and one more thing like please add something from which we can arrange songs like when I want to arrange my songs i have to remove and add them again and again please do something...
5,Song/music selection is so easy to get plus other artists with a similar song/genre is available making youre playlist far more enjoyable....
4,Its a great app with tons of music and podcasts. My only issue with it is sometimes my favorites songs for an artist wont show up without closing and restarting the app and also that on those lists favorites tracks wont show up for every artists lists. Those are minor gripes though.
5,Love this app! Used to use I Heart Radio but it was starting to have some glitches so I switched to Spotify & havent looked back. Has the same amount of ads as I Heart Radio does but there arent too many ads where it becomes annoying.
5,Best music streaming service and Ive had Pandora & iHeart Radio. I dont waste my time with YouTube music. Do yourself a favor and upgrade to Spotify Duo. Best money ever spent.
4,This app is really amazing but this is one problem when Im using this app to listening the songs its always stop after the song play. Again and again again. Its irritating to me. :expressionless:
1,So.. I was able to add my songs but come on 6 skips per hour? For what?? Stupid & whenever I found my songs & pressed play it played a different song tf??? After all the trouble I could only add 4 songs in 1 hour FYI I already knew what songs I wanted to add and when I pressed Play on my playlist it started playing Recommended songs tf I pressed play on my play list. Overall I didnt enjoy this & Im not paying money cause itll end up useless anyway.
1,Soon as I lock my screen within 5 mins or so it stops playing then I have to change song for it to work. (Its not on sleeping battery saver btw) nor is it on a timer on the actual app. Its been playing up now since last yeay
5,Perfect for playing other apps. I have this on my phone and I use it on my PS4; blasting through my television. Its truly a remarkable experience and definitely a app worth utilizing. I also believe purchasing the premium is mandatory if you want the full-on experience especially if youre a music lover!
5,I love Spotify! I use it all the time. I dont get the Premium because I dont ACTUALLY need it. It is a GREAT music app. I can link it up to other accounts and I can use It while using other accounts. Spotify is just all around simply amazing. Its my favorite just music app. Other than Spotify I use YouTube. Both are Superb and Excellent sources of music. Top Notch. Top Dollar. Number One. Im glad I had the opportunity to write this great review. Have an amazing day and Take Care!
2,This app is just OK but the unsubscribe process requires way tooo many times clicking cancel! I have made my mind dont force me to click cancel 5 times to unsubscribe. I clicked it three times last month and thought I was done with it and was charged again for this month which feel very shity and inresponsive. Worst way to keep clients!
1,i keep restarting and un-installing the app but nothing seems to work. it keeps saying no internet connection and wont even let me log in even though i have checked multiple times and i am connected to strong internet. very frustrating because i use spotify frequently
1,Spotify opening when I try to play audio from My Files. I have not given it permission to do this and the only current workaround is to delete the app. Started very recently others in the music industry have had a similar problem with mobile.
5,The app is amazing nice to just come home after school or work and have a recommended playlist already made for you. I just wish it was a little bit easier to make your own playlist.
5,I just love Spotify because of the best blues selection I can get and also I can practice my guitar through the backtrack options it allows me to enjoy practice and listening to.
3,Annoying habit of not working for voice commands. Works for a while and then just randomly keeps on playing whats already there and I have to look through search results to select it manually. Had to completely reinstall spotify to get it to work a couple of days ago and now its started doing it again.
2,Terrible for music listening.. when singles are clicked most of the times theres nothing coming after them.. algorithms dont build playlist based on that song like yt music does.. its only good because there is Joe Rogan one more star is for him otherwise would have rated 1
5,Just a wonderful app to store music stream live and plus more! I highly recommend it if you are wanting to not only get a great exercise in but experience good music with all your downloaded music you pick and choose from!
4,Awesome overall. But it happens a lot when they say enjoy the next 30min of add free listening but then I get adds in that time.
3,I love this app but I give only 3 stars because when I go into another app it will kick me off of Spotify and I have to go into the app and restart my music. Its very frustrating
1,Cant even go to albums after the new terrible update. First rule of software dont fix what isnt broken. Too much worrying about Joe Rogan and not enough on the actual product.
5,My discovery weekly playlist is the best musical thing that happened to me in a long time :pray::heart:? ! Its simply so spot on  Ive discovered the best music. Thanks a lot guys !
3,After the new update spotify has stopped auto playing with my Ford Focus 2014 SYNC! Before it used to start playing my music automatically from where I left off as soon as I turned the car key. But now I have to manually open spotify & start my playist & also keep spotify app open. If I close the app it stops automatically playing & my widget also goes blank & unresponsive when pressing the play button! Please sort this if possible. Using a Samsung S10 Lite worked perfectly before update.
4,Its cool and you can also listen to any kind of music you want but there is kind of a problem every time you leave an rejoin it kind of freezes So if you fix this problem I will give it 5 stars Bye-bye
1,When I go to a song ot gives me another one which isnt close to the one i want. I can only skip 6 times a hour which i understand you need to make money is a stupid idea. If i get a playlist with tje song i want its useless because then i need to listen to song i dont need to.
1,Nonsense. I can deal with ads I know apps need to make money. Why is it playing video for podcast when I dont want it. I dont care how little data it might use it is my data. Podcast often freeze because it is either loading video or trying to keep insync with audio as well. . and now weven though I have it set to only play video on wifi it continues to play video when on cellular. FU Spotify
5,One of the best music apps! Love how you can download playlists to listen to offline. I just had account issues where nothing was playing. Contacted there customer support in a chat. Was literally so helpful and my account is alive again! Love when big companies still have good customer support to solve those random problems technology has.
1,It asks me to give permission to play on background but doesnt actually have that option and i used be able to play with my phone open or locking my phone but be on the app and it will 0lay but now every 10 seconds it stops and i have 4 bars on 5G. Spotify isnt what it used to be.
3,THE NEW UPDATE. I liked the old version better how do you even make it worse. The new one is really complicated I dont like Spotify that much anymore...
5,Great platform to listen to music they have litterally every song i like and not too much ads at once (meameanwhile at the sametime we all understand that they need ads for money to keep the app running)
5,This is honestly the only intuitive and high quality app Ive been using daily for years. Some minor glitches not worth mentioning comparing to the competition.
2,Review of Premium Spotify: App automatically turns off Loop and Shuffle. It also pauses itself displays wrong album cover and wrong playlist cover. Ive had it skip songs by itself and plays songs with no sound. Not every time but enough that its been a noticable hassle.
2,Premium costs too much and there are songs that are missing but interface is amazing. Doesnt allow downloaded songs on mobile for some reason
4,Its amazing always entertaining. ....but i need spotify to remove ads while listening musics it sometimes ruins mood overall its an good app.
2,Good service. App freezes on one track and qont change at the bottom even when new tracks play. F ing annoying.
5,I love Spotify! I have discovered so much new music I would otherwise never heard. The only negative I could say is that you cant always find the exact song you are looking for.
5,I love this app i love how you can play any song you want! But the ads are annoying. I usally get 10 ads in a row. 10! Way to many! but other than that amazing app lol
2,This app routinely stops working. Playing a song/podcast? Be prepared for the app to randomly close and then after you open it back up that song/podcast/playlist will no longer play unless you reinstall the app or restart your device. Its happening multiple times per week at this point.
5,Love being able to download 5 favorite songs so I can still listen when I go through patchy connection areas. Having lyrics added has been the best improvement done! I love that the time spent cooking has turned into karaoke sessions! :joy:
1,Podcasts randomly change to the next episode and I lose my place. Also constant ads and popups to Buy premium. OFFER ENDING SOON yeah I know its been ending for like 3 years.
2,The UI for podcasts is horrible and it never remembers where I was. Thank goodness the JRE is the only Spotify exclusive podcast that I listen to!
3,I like the app but there are too many ads when Im listening to music. Enjoy the next 30 minutes of ad-free listening. But an ad plays two songs later
1,They say you can play local files through the app and while thats technically true local files are all just dumped in a single giant playlist with no layered organization. This makes local file playing all but useless. I live in Alaska and often drive places where I dont have reliable phone connection so an app that doesnt have a usable local file option is not workable to me.
3,The algorithm is just dumb. Pay the artist! Instead of songs going to a cache maybe let access them as downloaded tracks? Its just dumb having 5gb of cache and 5gb of downloaded songs when the cache is nothing more then what played after my downloaded artists. The algorithm is also JOKE! For example it will cycle through 2 Ramones songs even though it could pick any of their songs to the same user experience. It is no wonder every artist has two song that are played disproportionately more.
5,This is the best music app I have ever downloaded. Its really easy to use and even without premium this app is still amazing. I also really like this app because I can definitely tell that they care a lot about their listeners. At the end of the year they do a little collage of your most listened to songs and artists which I thought was really cute and they also made a couple of playlists based off of your most played artists and songs. Im very satisfied.
3,Love the service! Just wish they had lyric videos with the canvases. Still 5 stars!!:horns_sign|type_3: But my canvas are gone! Its not an option on my settings and I own a Galaxy S21 ultra. Why Spotify why?!?! This is the second time!!!
1,wrost experience ever... keep popping ad after every song just hate that experience... so terrible... if possible to rate in negative i would rate in -infinity dont install it..
5,The app has starting issues sometimes. I have to close and reopen the app even twice at times. I would appreciate if swipe to queue were added the same way it is in iOS. I really like the app tho
5,So far really enjoying it ! Not just the music but podcasts to now they need to figure something out to watch shows or moviefun clips that would be great!
2,Cant access downloads without connection. Its so absurd I download things because I love in an area that doesnt have cell reception everywhere. The app tries to load entire libraries before it will allow navigation to downloads. Negating the entire purpose of downloads. Plus the navigation is just silly/unintuitive.
5,DONT CHANGE! I love it. I especially like that on podcasts I can speed up the audio! :hugging: I love being able to listen to the JRE!
4,I been premium for a year by now and i like it... And i am here to just tell you that spotify should cancel plans cause I use student premium plan that has is a YEAR PLAN but instead of stoping the plan..... my plan switch to normal premium which doubled payment and that i couldve use for two month plan.... the problem is that it is already automatedly paid which i dont know if it could be refunded...
1,For hells sake do something about this bloody payment issues man!! Every month I try to renew my subscription Im redirected to websites and something or other goes wrong with payment!! Its really frustrating and very damn annoying!!!!
1,Horrible creators. The old interface was amazing and it downgraded so much because of the creators incompentence and greedines. Want to listen to a song? You cant. Wait for 100 songs to play before you get to it. Have 50 ads in between too. DONT download this garbage. The only thing its good for is being compared to better music apps. Id give it a 0/10 if I could.
3,Great app when it works. Sometimes it randomly chooses to redownload offline songs for no reason and other times those offline songs become completely unplayable. This has been going on for years and Spotify wont fix it
4,I want comment section in this app ..else everything is perfect and english lyrics to of non-english songs... If this feature comes that would be great.
2,Love the app in general but there is a problem with the podcast system. Spotify does not moderate its content when it comes to big players like Joe Rogan. It will take down smaller podcast episodes that intentionally spread misinformation but JRs episodes that spread conspiracy theories and even feature hate groups (is the proud boys). While I do not believe in governmental censorship Spotify needs to take responsibility for the content that they are choosing to promote as exclusive.
4,It would be much better with English lyrics for all languages. And would like to have a good option for changing order of songs in a playlist.
5,Spotify is my current favorite music app. They have a very good student discount and such a wide music library that most if not all of the music Im into at any time is on there. Plus it works well never glitches and has a good setup for using
5,Ive used Apple Music before and theres honestly no comparison Spotify is better in every way. So many great features and you discover so much new music without any effort at all. Highly recommended.
5,Works excellently. Minimal issues and has virtually every song I want to listen to even in obscure genres.
4,Excellent database & search facilities. Also offline use & crossfade on windows desktop app. Unlike other streaming services. Only downside is still no cd quality or high res available. Unlike other streaming services. Come on spotify lets have it please.
1,Im giving 1 star because lyrics are not showing up still actually it never did in my oppo f9 pro free account .i tried everything clearing cache logging several times but no change so please look into this problem and solve it asap
5,I love the music experience its amazing. You got to try it out to believe me. They have a playlist for each any every moment party relaxing chilling you name it.... You just flow with the music... Good vibes always :blush:
1,plays ads on podcasts even though I have premium whats worse is it restarts the podcast when it plays so i lose my place edit: the app is getting worse its crashing all the time for me
3,Collection is good. Cant say the same for the lyrics feature though... It has been butchered for a tamil movie song and I guess theres a lot of butchering happened.. If you are gonna put the feature please do a QA first.
1,Spotify used to be great but this last update made it so I have to pay to skip songs I cant pick 1 song because its jumbled up with others and the ads are constant. It was fine before they made it worse.
5,Has a music lover. This app is good and huge collection of music but one thing is about adds .Spotify broadcast same adds repeatedly please change adds after one by one and make some long gape between two adds its comes quickly soo please solve it:hugging::hugging::hugging:
1,Its great if you enjoy pod casts in 15 minute increments then need to restart because it shuts itself off and closes.
5,It is very good app I love it . But there is a problem it shows very much ads. My friend has given a title adiify
5,Opini�n Good opini�n This is the best app in world :earth_americas: as my opinion because i wasnt able to find best app where i can listen song and i can hear songs easily and that why i love it.I want that prople promote it so all can hear song. Greatest opini�n I was very glad when i open it they give option of to choice your own singers that you love and top list was BTS that make me soooo happy because bts is my life Bad opinion The thing i dont like that when i want to save song it cant easily save.
1,I dont know how but they got access to my account during an identity theft investigation. VERY SKETCHY! Considering the fact that they do not have my account nor routing number and before I could get access to put money into my NEW account they took the monthly amount and caused a new issue.
1,App is buggy. Keeps playing music I dont want even though I did not select enhance mode in my play list. Please fix.
1,Like until the most recent update. Now I cant listen to anything pages playlists and searches wont load. Useless and frustrating. What happened?! Update: theyve done a couple updates since ive tried reinstalling etc. Still useless. And ive never heard back from support. Even more useless and frustrating. The ONLY saving grace is i found a different app that i actually like way better for podcasts. But ffs i miss my playlists.
1,I recently tried using this with an Amazon Echo Dot... the ads are way too loud. It seems like the articles I seen online from Spotify the ones that said they fixed this issue were lies. Its not just a few ads. Its closer to 90% of them that will blow your ears out.
4,Yea Im just kinda sad Im forced to have to pay premium for a good experience. otherwise its not a ad every 30 min its more like every other song. But other than that its pretty cool you can make Playlists .
5,Its amazing its so easy it makes listing to music a hobby because it gives you suggestions taylored to your tastes so you dont have to search for good songs all the time!
1,Paid for the mini which was premium and now they updated it to 30 songs limited to download. And the way to save the song you want to download is so sketchy. Plus the downloaded playlist doesnt load without internet. What???
2,Since last update the app has been running horribly. Fix this problem and the app is 5 stars Update: updated on the 13th STILL NOT FIXED.
1,Unfortunately Spotify no longer downloads to my SD card formatted for internal storage. Rather its forced to use my phones internal storage. Strangely this only occurred recently. In 2021 and before I had no issue storing my downloads on my SD card. Now the option to change my musics storage has disappeared.
2,Is it the compatibility of the app and my phone or my music doesnt play at all. I already updated the app uninstalled and installed it and even purchasing a one-day premium just to listen to music but still it doesnt load.
1,When used at first the app was all good but as soon as I kept using it and paly songs or make a liked list it keeps playing adds for premium back to back unless you finally get irritated and close the app . Spotify neens to know that keep showing adds back to back 1st 2nd and 3rd 4th time wont attract its customers rater will make them feel irritated we open the app for songs not for the adds .
3,Love the music thats available but would be better if you could access it without paying for premium and then have Spotify recommend quite alot of tunes that are already in your Playlists and what is with all the updates?? Updated only yesterday and am being asked to update again today... but when I go to the app very little seems to have changed and if anythng theirs more glitches to it so Im not gona update again.
1,The mobile application is trash. On PC it plays the song you want and then random songs. On mobile it shuffles songs so I can never listen to the one I want. While I love spotify for PC Its horrible for mobile.
4,My experience has been great. The algorithm has been good with my taste of music and podcasts. I do not like the black background without the choice to change the color like other platforms. Hence the 4 stars. (Meant to be 3 stars cause the color is a bug to my eyes)
5,I love how Spotify constantly analyzes your music whether its old or new and puts together numerous Playlist Recommendations that include music you know & music that youre not familiar with but sounds like something you might enjoy !! (*And of course you can pick and choose WHATEVER music podcast you want at any given time :notes::guitar::microphone::headphones::drum_with_drumsticks: :radio: )
3,actually i would to rate the app with 5 stars but the stupid ptoblem is ads. The heck they show ad after 1 single song as if the app is going to for our premium. Nonsense people! So i would suggest other that if want to download this then get ready to pay for the app or else reaelly forget spotify because they interrupt you a lot while hearing to songs.
4,After a update some time ago the buttons on the notification are always black even when the song has black background. Its annoying but not deal breaking. The other issue is when I change songs on another device with my phone the song changes but on the phone it gets stuck on timestamp 0.01 and the buttons to change songs stop working. Then I have to go back and forth between the main menu and song display to change them. Other than that it works.
4,Great app. Smooth experience. Sometimes connections can drop but not necessarily the apps issue
3,Songs doesn�t play correctly.If I tap on one song this app play the first song of the artist album. It doesn�t matter what song it is Again there isn�t any option to see songs of playlists. If I skip to find right one it show I can skip 6 time max. If there is so many shortcomings how did this app became so famous. If you wanna sell premium give some extra feature there not making this app boring or unusable for free user.
4,I am an ardent purchaser of music on cds i rip and play back in various ways. My children have purchased me this credit because they wanted to show me how it is for them. My verdict is good I like the fact that i can try stuff I wouldnt normally and checking out stuff i wanted and never got round to. The cost of �120 for a year is a big burden for me I doubt I spend that much on CDs as i look for the bargains and 2nd hand. You need to be cheaper to keep me.
5,Best music streaming app so far Music database is good but still lacking a few old records. But its okay..
5,I am having the best.time using Spotify. I have playlists to diehfor songs I had forgotten a long time ago I was easily able to find them using playlists already provided by Spotify. Nice one
1,As they allow misinformation to be spread on their platform it must be a one star. Should have been minus 10 but doesnt have that option...
1,Spotify started opening when I tried to play audio files on my phone with absolutely no permissions. I uninstalled it and not even logged in it become my default audio player. It makes my files obsolete because they wont play and spotify wont let me open my phones audio player. Smh.
2,I dont like how I can only shuffle play which is really annoying since my playlist gets messed up every time I play it but the addition of random songs to my playlist is even worse so now instead of spotify I use youtube for my music.
3,Five star rating once I have received an update that you guys will release lossless option for songs. Every one is doing it why cant you. I love Spotify and its algorithm but I use apple music for spatial and Dolby atmos content. Please Spotify release the atmos and spatial option :relieved:
2,I honestly hate it when i get random songs that i didnt even ask for the ads keep coming everytime when i finish 2-3 songs telling me to buy spotify prem also i turned off the option where it would not add in random songs in my playlist yet it does on my phone fix ur stuff on phone stop focusing on money
2,You gotta play ad after every songs and that too three ads all at once you need to understand that not everyone can use premium! Fix this thing please rest its a nice app if it doesnt play ads after every song?
2,Why is it that everytime I listen to Spotify it always stops? Its been likes this for a while now and it is so annoying. I mean even with the downloaded songs with wifi or mobile data it always stops. I pay monthly for what? I have to open the app every second just to continue listen to the song.
2,Every second day i have to reinstall the app and clear cache because when i try to shuffle liked songs it only plays songs that arent in the playlist. It started around christmas and hasnt stopped since. When the app worked it was really good but now Im praying the next song is one in my playlist Literally just had to reinstall after less than an hour since the last time. Please fix this
1,Have been a loyal spotify customer for years but in the past 6 months upsates to the app cause it not to work. Sometimes the app wont even open and if it does it takes a whole 5 minutes. Phone is a galaxy S8 so nothing to do with hardware. Once it takes an eternity to open the app will say i am not connected to the internet even when I am via wifi or data. Lastly i updated my account to a duo account with my partner but their songs are not included in duo playlist. CS hasnt been any help.
3,Downloaded songs get deleted once the premium pack that you have bought comes to end..and I just hate this feauture:triumph: I really thought that once I download a song I can listen to it anytime even after the premium pack ends..it really disappointed me a lot
3,Problem is am finding it difficult to play music in my play list. And its impossible to repeat or play a previous song. Is it that I dont know how to use this app or what?
5,** UPDATE ** I am pleased to post an update. The Android version of the Spotify app continues to have a much lower volume when using the equalizer... however either a Chromebook update or a Spotify app update corrected the sound quality of the music to such a degree that I no longer need to use the equalizer. GOOD JOB!!!
2,Everytime I need to search the song ad play I cant enjoy songs because of its Random shuffle is very bad. If I search one song then it doesnt shuffles and stops after playing only one song.
4,Id rather just download the songs and listen it in my own music app yall just spending money just to get rid for ads while your own music app doesnt have it plus the songs I want is not here even though it kind of takes some of your storage its just like 3mb and downloading this one is 26mb or more plus when you use it more it will just increase thats it.
5,Best music app out there. Its like YouTube except you can listen with your screen off. If you actually have patience and dont throw fits like toddlers through the ads its a great app
2,Recently after I updated my phone I cant install the app from anywhere. Pls tell me a solution for this issue. My phone got lot of storage and there is a good internet connection. Kindly find the issue and tell me the solution. I use Samsung M11. And I found that only in this device I am unable to install the app.
2,There is way to many adds. You cannot get a max of 5 songs in and almost the whole time you try and listen almost the whole time its adds.
1,Everytime Im listening to a podcast and turn the screen the off my media will stop playing almost 100% of the time even if the timer is on and set to a later time. Sometimes the player stays stuck on a past episode or it reads a timestamp that Ive already passed long ago making me lose my place. If Spotify wants to seriously contend with other podcast platforms it needs to address these chronic issues
1,Worst user Interface. They pay out millions but apparently dont pay their programmers enough to make the user Interface Intuitive. Garbage. Spent 5 minutes trying to figure out how to go back to an audiobook on spotify. If its not possible without premium say so. Garbage. Ill stick with YouTube and their evil overlords
1,is this music and podcast app or ads app every two or one songs there is three ads and I am not available to buy any subscription of spotify and any app. Please reduce ads on Spotify.
1,It has good quality downloads but I hate that it adds songs to playlist s and if I want to listen to one it will only give me the preview it is so annoying is this like a setting or something cuz its better to just Google song now
4,I use it a little bit but not enough to buy premium and its kinda annoying not being able to pick a song and play it whenever. Additionally my Spotify just crashed so Im here trying to reinstall.
5,I really enjoy Spotify its the best ever. I plan to update on Spotify this month. I love the oldies music. Thank you for giving all of us such great music to enjoy.
1,not sure what the issue is but at this point I cant listen to one song without it randomly pausing itself and glitching out. not worth paying money for anymore.
4,Since the last update Spotify turno off by itself when you are listening to something it does not move to the next track and I have to keep closing it out to see if it works better but nothing helps. I use it every day and I pay for it.
3,Two missing stars for the lack of two important features that the competition do better. Flow with deezer and searching for a sing song playing in the background. Three stars for remote control and great library. I dont enjoy daily mix and my playlist /song radio give me 5 songs on repeat.
3,The update is SO not it. I would have been way more better like how it was where you could just listen to liked songs and skip as many as you like but now I have to pay and I honestly think that its unnecessary. Then yall even add songs that I didnt want or ask for..so in that case I will rate it at a 3 but it would have been a 5.
5,Spotify has helped me to enjoy music while dancing with my kids working out cooking and getting to sleep. Thank you!
3,Sometimes glitchy and I would expect better optimization from this app. Also why doesnt the sleep timer always work? There should be more sleep timer options (custom time) and it should always be available no matter what you are listening to.
5,Spotify is trying to play.. This notification doesnt go after cache clear reinstall phone restart. Using OnePlus 6 Android 10. Never had this issue before but since few months now. Very irritating. No help on internet forums.
1,They would have gotten 5 stars from me except they from nowhere decided to charge me twice in December and then again this month in January thank God I was a bit smarter and faster than they were although they almost had me convinced to update my payment so that they could unpause a subscription I had already paid for and their plan was to just charge my account again for this month and they can keep their music and their app and shove it up their behinds.
1,Bro when in hell didnt i need 6 skips a day to skip a song i just dont want to listen to? and what happend to my playlist spotify it wont work its stuckon edit playlist you guys deserve this 1 star till my stuff gets fixed or someone tell me what did i do wro ng or something here im currently thing about switching to soundcloud now bc of this so think fast
5,One of the best apps ever! I love how easy it is to use Spotify and how easily accessible it is to find my music as well as new music. The system that recommends music based on the music you listen is very good as I am constantly finding new music that I now love.
4,Scince the new update I cant see the lyrics for any song. I really want this bug to get fixed. I have always loved and used spotify
3,I have to drop this rating down a star as the last 3 versions of the app it no longer refreshes song title on car Bluetooth. It will stay on the first song played
5,Absolutely love it! Got a premium account right away a few years ago totally worth it! I use my account on phone tv and especially my car! The ability to make personalized playlists is awesome!!!
1,Comes on by itself and starts playing music. There is no stop button. Twice shut my phone off to stop it. This time Im deleting the app.
1,Spotify is like a maze enter it and ull be lost. Its very eh kinda useless wihout premium both spotify and spotify lite. Multiple ads cant download and etc.
4,Please allow us to select multiple songs at a time and add them to a Playlist. Its kinda annoying having to select each song individually to add them to a Playlist. Also have a library for all downloaded songs different from liked songs
5,Great music app which is richfully filled to the brim of all genres and types of music both obscure and popular which is great.
5,Its a little hard for me to learn where to go to put my music and how to change them in the order that they were played or downloaded but 99% of this is actually me because Im technologically stupid Spotify has been very good to me you have found some songs I thought no one would ever hear again and so I decided to up you one star thank you
3,Fantastic app with Premium but feels like a demo without - Too many features are off-limits for free plans most of which are available for all on the Desktop version.
4,Kinda slow at times but I think thats just because of my device. Learned all the words to the songs from Encanto!
3,The app stops and goes off when I am using other apps while listening to songs on this. I have to restart it everytime which is really annoying.
1,Are you looking for commercials? Spotify has lots of commercials. Also commericals are so much louder then the music it actually hurts my ears when they come on compared to the music. Updated 01/13/22... sooo many commercials.
1,songs stop playing randomly then youre out of the app. playlists are back on shuffle so you cant choose the song you want to listen to and youll have to interrupt your work to play another song. thats nonsense. whats the point of this music app if you cant play the songs youd love to listen to in your playlist. please fix that
2,Needs to be worked on. There are plenty of apps out there that have excellent features but you cant get certain podcasts on them because theyre exclusive. So youre forced to listen to an app that acts up and doesnt do what youd like it to do. And if you pay for premium it doesnt help.
5,Spotify is the worlds best music app it it very fun to use when you. Are board or just wanna listen to music or podcast or even make something.
4,This app is amazingly good! You can find almost ANY SONG! But you only have 6 skips an hour unless you pay for Premium which isnt a bad problem! :)
4,Thus far I love the app may I suggest that the lyrics be made available for the offline mode. I still want to sing off key to accurate lyrics even when I am offline :laughing:
1,Picked it up since some of my fav podcasts went exclusive fortunately it was only for a year as this app is trash. Clunky UI excessive ads (including inserting them into podcasts which would be ad free on any other platform) and trying to listen to music is even worse (which they pay the artists nothing for). Also I cant directly prove their responsible for Joe Rogan complete losing his mind but it seemed to be around the same time he joined up. Coincidence?
4,Brilliant app generally but not working I tried clearing the cache and uninstalling then reinstalling and still not working. **Eventually got it sorted after numerous attempts of clearing storage data and only logging in when there was no other app activity frustrating but hopefully will be seen to in the next update**
1,They went to constant ads for free version. Its useless unless you b pay. It also hijacks my android and starts playing when I dont select it.
1,So basically if I want this app to properly work its come down to me having to wipe all data from storage and reopen it like a freshly downloaded app every day because its become so buggy Ive been using Spotify premium for years its crazy how theyve constantly made it worse through non user friendly UI and bugs
4,Im using the family plan.... and its the best value for music compared to any streaming service..... comes with 6 accounts and each account is its on serperatw single user account..... well worth the price.... would have gevin it 5 stars if spotify would support a higher quality....if ur an audiophile and u value quality over price i would def go with somthing like tidal but for the average person spotify checks all the boxes as what a streaming service should be..... glad lyrics were added!
1,Repeatedly crashes all the time very frustrating to pay for a premium membership and still be dealing with random drops in audio. You have to open the app back up click on what you were listening to and press play..sometimes it cuts out again as soon as you turn off the screen
5,Amazing and easy to navigate. Contains about 95% of songs you want. Awesome features. However if it could have a smarter search that would pick up on key words like Google that would make it that much better.
3,basically all I can do on here anymore is add music to my playlists. I have spotify on my laptop and my phone i would rate it a four on my phone but on my laptop whenever i try to play music it skips and glitches and wont play the music well
5,I love Spotify! Honestly couldnt live without it!! I use it for podcasts and music!
2,Tbh I really hate it I hate the fact that when I try to listen to my liked songs and Im listening to melenie Martinez then when. The song ends and it starts playing some random song Ive never even heard of and. The fact that we only get to skip 6 times is kind of sad Im really thinking of switching to a different music app I really like the app over all tho
3,Good app but they should let us download songs for free and the ads are irritating me Spotify dont think me wrong stop ads !!!!!!!!!
1,I always used the desktop software and it is good but this phone App is garbage. I understand advertisement but I dont understand it doesnt let me listen to the whole playlist or the album I selected. Basically without paying this is just a big random music broadcast app it doesnt play what you want it to play after 2 or 3 songs. I wont give it any star if I could.
1,The app and music is amazing it has every song I can think of.. but I absolutely HATE when a suggested song plays it ruins everything. I looked up how to turn it off but nothing helps. 1/5 app because of that.
1,This app is basically like a pay2win game. You NEED premium to actually access the app properly. I mean cmon no skips? Shuffle ONLY? No repeat? You really screwed up on this. Im literally about to download a pirated version of Spotify or delete it and never use it again. Change. The. Frickin. App. Let us use skips and loops and actually play the songs we want not search up the song and play a playlist of it.
1,Cannot log in after creating an account in the UK and moving to the US and the unhelpful error message is something went wrong.
1,The amount of ads is insane let alone the amount of covid ads you receive. My escape from the flood of news is working out which gets ruined because of the ads. I can understand some ads but more than a dozen in 30 minutes is ridiculous.
5,Getout this app is so good to have you can listen to great music and the music is family friendly with kids bop on it I would recommend it for all ages#best music app ever
4,I like the quality and its easy to use but I also dont know if its normal that you cant go in a radio station like for example when I want to go in Karol G radio station it just shows other stations and wont really let you play or see the songs in that station I just want to know if its normal or not.
4,It happened a couple of time that i got logged out and couldnt login and had to reinstall the app loosing all my downloads in the time of need. Other than that its fabulous for the price
1,It was really good but now they are trying to make you buy premieum just to listen to basic songs and skip through playlists
5,Love Spotify had it for years. Like the fact itll find tunes similar to my musical tastes so it introduces me to artists I would likely never have found. Playlists are easy to create podcasts are easy too whats not to like.
4,I gave it a four because its really good but its a bit confusing and when you want to listen to a song it will play a different song Whats kinda annoying:grin:
2,The app takes a good 20 seconds to open with a further unacceptable delay when playing the first song. Once its up and running its great but to get started is an absolute nightmare. So bad Im thinking about cancelling my premium account.
3,My music is recently turning off either while Im playing a game or my phone times ouy. Never happened before my cellphone provider said its the app itself but i dont know how to fix it  its frustrating while trying to listen to music
5,Great way to listen to music! Playlist curated for you plus you can choose radio stations or make your own Playlists listen to albums artists etc.
4,I love Spotify BUT whenever Im listening to a song it will cut off and shut down right away in the middle of the song! And then when one song is done you have to go back and push the play button and the song starts all over again. Its very frustrating PLEASE fix!
5,Premium version. its very good.. I have it for a while and its Just perfect.. free version its too much limited... But im some cases i can survive... I really hate you have only 6 skips on 6 hours and you cant play you favorite songs... pc version its better beacuse it have only ads... But after all I like it and I give it a 5 stars.
5,Amazing songs and playlists yo chose from. Endless songs and playlists. Look up you favorite artists and fing all of there songs. Overall amazing app!
2,Love the content. But the constant bugs make the experience very difficult to enjoy.
5,After burning cds as a kid and having to hold a recorder to the radio and then dealing with Napster and pandora I will never be a happy as I am with Spotify. And now theyve added lyrics. Worth the monthly payment vs having it free and getting commercials.
2,this is great but in the update I can no longer listen to downloaded podcasts. What is the point then? the whole organization system is a mess and I hate it.
1,Autostarts every morning after phone reset and i cant figure out how to disable this. If i put the app in deep sleep then it closes when the screen is off.
5,Out of all the music apps I have tried  Spotify is the best it has all the songs ur looking for easy to find and save its worth the download.
2,FFS why does it keep auto-stopping when I have my phone connected to a bluetooth speaker? So annoying. Even more annoying is the android bug that skips to a random track when you click the lock button on your phone. Happens literally everytime. Please add support for Android.
5,I have listen to music and have the Spotify app for over 6 years now and its been a blessing. Excellent source of music and podcast!..
4,Takes a very long time for the playlists tab and the podcasts tab to load. Sometimes it never loads.
1,Spotify used to be great but they have more than doubled the amount of adds that play. Unless you are a premium subscriber the ap isnt worth downloading.
3,Not for me. Cluttered too many cover songs. When I ask google speaker to play a song it always plays a weird version. I went from Spotify to Amazon music. Much better. By the way Spotify I cancelled my subscription why was I charged for this month?
5,One of my absolute favorite apps. The songs collection is really vast and the UI is very clean and minimal. The crossfade feature is amazing. So is the ability to control playback from any device.
2,Good app with lot of music but why you cant skip the song on playlist???? I was just trying to find my fav. Music by skipping the songs on playlist it says you skip 6times per hour why dont make android app like the pc one. In pc spotify better i thought now i can listen my songs anywhere with spotifys android version. Its not as good as i thought its WORST!!!!
4,Great service have been with for a while. Only complaint is not every song is available either really old ones you expect to be on here or really new ones that are everywhere but here.
3,App is great but the company has decided to put its money into really hate filled podcasts that appear to be more political propoganda then entertaining or informative podcasts. Ok for free music streaming but going to get podcasts elsewhere.
1,Ads after every 2-3 songs that too promoting Premium pretty irritating if you ask the people using your app. This is the reason I believe most of us are switching to other apps with better streaming. I am using MY DATA for the app why isnt that enough? What kind of a marketing strategy is this? The only thing youve gained from the persistent advertisments is a low rating on the play store app. People arent gonna buy premium just because you make them endure these ads.
5,Its my go-to daily music and podcast listening experience. Just waiting for that HiFi listening to become an option.
5,I have been a Spotify user for 3 years now and I can honestly say that it is one of the best music streaming services out there wether you want songs podcasts jokes books you name it . Honestly guy go get this app! Keep up the good work Spotify
5,Its a great application and has a wide range of options though very few songs are missing but it has many options. Overall great app
1,Music plays in the background without an icon to stop it. Spotify makes itself the dominant music app on my phone so even when I get in my car it will play even if I wasnt using it previously.
3,the only reason i give it a three is because you cant even skip and view a song without putting it in a playlist most music apps let you do this stuff even without paying
1,Spotify is a great app but the settings page sucks. I wouldnt mind making changes to my payment or adding memebers threw setting.right now its all complicated it legit took me 6 days finding how to access my account members and payment. Breeeh
5,Hands down Spotify is the best app for streaming music. The $9.99 for Spotify Premium is DEFINITLY worth it. Every time there might be an issue with the app the support always helps fix it. I love this app so much and I will continue to love it.
2,Gone from good to Poor!! use to rate this app but all it does is pause my songs after every 10secs done everything to stop this form happening by changing my data setting battery settings force stop clear cache uninstall to reinstall login out and back in and turn phone off and back on but still the issue still there sort it out Spotify!!! Done my side now do yours!!
4,It works. When I do not have access to my own library. The advertisements I do not have with my own library. They only serve to push the subscription. I do not use it enough to start paying for it.
2,Bugs and countless UX flaws would be acceptable in the case of a free or open source app. For an app with the monthly fee this feels like a joke. Plus the suggestion mechanism is rather poor.
5,I personally like Spotify... It allows me to listen to all my favorite songs its an awesome app. I can listen to my music anywhere on the planet its awesome.
5,Stellar. CD guy for many years. I have so much more money saved thanks to Spotify premium. Outstanding library sound quality features and wicked user friendly. Highly highly highly recommend it.
3,Daily use. Paid family subscription. The only issue is a big one for all of us-it stops playing randomly multiple times during each session.
2,I have used Spotify for years. I know the podcast feature is fairly new. Please fix the video feature on JRE.
1,The stupid playlists should not update until I have wifi and it needs to be easier to find music that I have downloaded. As some one who works in a cooler where I have no wifi or signal its infuriating to have the playlists get deleted the second I step out of the cooler in the morning.
5,Love this App its clear cut easy to use and I love the fact you have amazing people who upload podcasts that are giving balance and information to people. I joined to listen to Joe Rogan who is a master in his field of journalism in my view. The app is brilliant and the content is fast becoming my favourite.
3,Pretty good although I wish I could listen to a specific song on a playlist without having to shuffle-skip to it!
4,Spotify is awesome app for listening music but 1 give 1 star for a reason. Spotify should make account deleting more user friendly it is very difficult to delete multiple accounts.
2,Ive been enjoying so far However if i wanna buy premium (cuz I havent subscribed yet) it wont let me it always says Oops please try again or contact our team i tried over and over again and it didnt work so please fix it i just wanna have premium (and u can have my money  if u want it) pls fix it thats all
5,Spotify has ease of use and millions of songs to choose from and if you choose to get premium say goodbye to ads and hello to Playlists really there is no way to go wrong with this app
3,Decent interface for normal music playback on mobile. However the removal car mode was a step in the wrong direction. Removing the big-buttoned simple driving interface that reduces driver distraction was great and voice controls are not an adequate substitute.
2,Where the heck is the shuffle button?! Why? just why?! :weary:there isnt a shuffle button to stop the auto shuffle and no loop button! Why?! :sob: And the only solution for this is to open the app on a laptop and turn the shuffle off :triumph: Bruh i dont have a laptop!!:face_with_symbols_on_mouth:
5,Its a wonderful app. I enjoyed using it to listen to different organizations Podcast and also search for music by different artists.
2,Everytime I finish listening to a playlist and want to play it again it plays random songs I dont want and I cant restart the playlist. Also why do I get 4 adds in a row every hour? And why limit the amount of skips so I buy premium? Having a download option is justification enough for premium.
1,Not the biggest fan of it. Design doesnt look as good as Apples. 5 skips in the free version is a just mean to be brutally honest. When I try to open an album... it doesnt open instead it opens something wierd and I hate that. Then I try to play a song from that album... and it ends up playing a remix (which isnt even part of that album) of the song I wanna hear or just a random track. Idk what Premium is like but free... just SUCKS! Thats why Im giving it 1 star. :blush:
2,Constantly stops playing randomly. In the middle of podcasts it will stop and mark as played when there is half of the show left. Will randomly stop playing music.
4,Id rate this 5 stars if the driving mode hadnt stopped working. Re-installed and updated to no avail.
4,Fairly decent music app. Lots of features and music choices. Little glitchy at times and some if the hidden permissions it requires for its self are a bit shady feeling but overall... not a terrible option out of the other currently available choices on play store.
5,I :heart: this music app u can stream & create your own playlist by listenin any type of music genre artists or bands of your choice. Way better than usin CDs iPod & radio. :+1::smiling_face_with_hearts::heart_eyes::heart:
3,Its a good music app it just ignores my setting and plays songs that I dont like in the middle of my liked songs and interrupts my 30 mins ad free with tips on the app that I have known for over 2 years
5,I just like Spotify because I can liston day and night and it doesnt eat up my GBs and it plays all of the greats I like to hear.
3,Spotify is so good. But New updated spotify virson is difficult to manage .so the old virson which was not updated it was much good than this new updated virson.
1,The most annoying app ever. Its a pity my friends send me links sometimes to open a music track on Spotify otherwise Id have deleted it forever. Super user-unfriendly especially when you want to play something on the not-premium version. I prefer to listen to music on YouTube. At least you can look something up for free!!!!
2,Its fine except for the fact that I had to watch an ad so I wouldnt get any for 30 mins and after 2 songs I get an ad? Make it make sense please
5,The app is literally a vibe. Really it is so cool and I more than love it and on top of that I had some trouble and the customer service is absolutely fine. Id 100% recommend it to anyone.
5,Im a decade behind on the times. I finally downloaded Spotify to find a song I wanted to hear and I discovered Podcasts. :+1::+1:
3,Unable to log in to spotify account. Tried to search email id or phone No. to contact customer support service but didnt get proper contact details where I can lodge complaint... it seems there is no any customer support service team... hence uninstalled.
2,Great selection the latest issue is that Spotify will keep stop playing randomly but all other apps dont have that kind of behavior.
3,Honestly I love this app.. Because its really nice and cool.. But there are some issues what disappointed me..cause some songs is not found.. :neutral_face::neutral_face:And some times it will play where it stopped.. So we cant change play lists or songs... Plz fix those problems next time :blush:
1,App keep crashing and music keep stopping. I have stopped subscribing to premium due to this. May even uninstall thereafter.
3,Best music app at the moment. ads wont bother you during one or thrice song. the ads are balanced on playlist. but theres one more thing that is not available to the users is that hiding unwanted podcasts. theres this one podcast about sex and im not really interested in that. (that podcast is in my recommendations) its really annoying it makes me lose interest in listening to my own playlist it just ruins my day. therefor this apps good. this app is like my casette tapes back in the day.
1,Everytime I try to play a song on here lately it crashes my phone. When it does play seems to be using more battery too. Is this from last update? If so how do I roll it back?
5,Hey bro please make a widget like we can see lyrics on our screen... Like multitasking..!! This is a small advice like so many people want this...! just add this and overall I loved this app Thank you for making this app..:sparkling_heart:
4,The premium experience is truly premium. Excellent song suggestions and a vast catalogue. I suppose my only criticism is the inability to download individual songs for offline listening but apart from that solid app.
1,Worst update to ever come cant even pick the song you want to listen to from your playlist doesnt have high res audio.
5,Yeah its a nice app if you buy the subs but without it the ads are annoying like they do emotional damage...nah...jk... its a good app without subs too...but please i would like to say that use material ui type things it enhanceses user experience...
2,My parents said to switch to spotify from pandora and honestly it was the worst idea ever. It never wants to load and when im listening to anything it suddenly pauses and wont play anything for hours. It constantly freezes or says there is no connection.
1,Cant even pick what song you want. On top of that spotify adds in a ton of songs into your playlist making the playlist spotify wants not the one you want. Pretty much forcing you to buy premium
1,I will give this 1 star just because its soooo impossible to submit a ticket/message/talk to someone from customer support. Unbelievable. I had my first bug and I am shocked for such an important app to offer 0 possibility to write your problem to someone. Ive tried to go to the community but Submit Form page doesnt work then the chat doesnt work when you want to start a new topic/new message. My bug: the Hide feature doesnt work at all. I mark a song as Hidden but it still plays
5,Always solid audio quality very few glitches to the app and when there are any glitches they seem to fixed them quickly! Also daily mixes are the best thing ever! And plenty of podcasts if thats more your avenue
2,Ive left Spotify now . Im sick and tired of not getting the songs in my play list and getting just random songs playing. :unamused:
2,Worked just fine (exclude the apps) but recently there have been issues. I start any playlist and it randomly plays songs which are not even a part of my playlist.
1,i dont like the new update of app. the last version was so good. but the new update sucks. the add are so many unlike last time. and whats with the shuffle? its hard to use ever since the new update. you need to wait for like an hour just to listen to the song you want.
3,Music arrangement is good.Though when one chooses an album for a specific artist one still finds other artists music in there.
5,This app is amazing :clap:. You can hear podcasts about your favorite books. Just one thing. Kindly add the oodcast for the book the Delirium Trilogies. Thanks :blush:
4,I really enjoy all of the features and benefits of Spotify for a year and a half already. Though I have a lot of good and bad to say what I really am irritated about the Android app is one UX issue � when you open options menu for a certain track you should wait some time before it actually opens. I dont know why it is done this way iOS app had it just fine with immediate response to the button but here I have to wait for animation to end. I beg you please remove it
2,Whats with the shuffle thing and why is that my only option to play the song in the album????? Let me listen to stuff I like and not wait for it to come up in the shuffle???? Like what the hell I dont want to listen to stuff I dont like just so that I can find the one I personally like its such a stupid feature and also why the hell cant I choose a song to play in an album why the heck do I have to put it on shuffle??? Its so hard to work with honestly and its such a stupid update
5,I love this app so much app the songs and podcasts you want to listen to I definitely prefer getting premium or the family plan because then you dont have to deal with the adds but I definitely recommend getting this app.
5,Spotify gives you any and all music that there is to listen to absolutely free and creates mixes based on the music that you listen to. I highly recommend this app to anybody who likes music.(Who doesnt like music?) This app also gives podcasts absolutely free that tell great stories if you like stories(Again who doesnt like stories?) Did I mention that it was free?
4,It uses a lot of battery but experience is very good about this app also its adds not even makes interruption but sometimes it also informs us about latest updates only issue is with battery eventhough i have 5000mah battery is uses about 2% per 10 minutes
1,Spotify was great before this new update this new update made me not want to stream songs on this app ever.(Only on my phone though) I hate that I cant pick one song to listen to and the only way I can listen to that specific song is that I need to shuffle my playlist in order to listen to that song??!!!! And I hate that I can only skip songs 6 times per hour!!!! And that I cant playback songs anymore. I dont recommend this app to anyone who has never used the app before or If you have.
4,I previously used iheart radio app but due to constant issues I swapped to Spotify ...so glad I did. Always works great and I can edit song and playlists. Only issue is that I have to manually open the app every time it connects to my car via Bluetooth but never used to do this
2,9.99 for 3 months is what the standard should be. No way will I pay anymore than that for this buggy invasive irritating and frustrating app. When it works 100% its a great app. Unfortunately it typically falls short of that mark.
1,Worst and greediest app Cant replay or choose the song cs i have to get Premium :skull:. Honestly YT is better trust me dont waste ur money on trash like this 0 out of 10. U can just listen to the song u liked once and then u cant how matter u try
1,Worst music experience. Theres too much ads!!! Im tired of been forced to buy Spotify Premium.All songs and Artists in the world are present here but theres so much ads that makes this app worse and more worse. Amazon Prime Music is better than this.
4,Giving it a four star because of the ads. Free profile user may get ads but not to such extent that they feel frustrated and feel like uninstalling the app rather than upgrading to premium membership. I would love it more and wont hesitate to give a 5 star if the ads are lessened to some extent...
1,Why do I need premium for selecting the song I want to hear on mobile but not on other devices its a pain for me to play the song I want to listen to with just shuffle especially when you have 700+ songs in your liked list.
4,Wish there was a way to your Playlist in order with out paying a lot of money. Something was wrong with the algorithm for awhile. Will give another try .
1,App doesnt open. Shows no internet connection when Im running on net that plays youtube videos at 1080 without buffering. 3 ads after every 2 songs. Lots of data and battery usage.
4,Keeps switching to radio without a reason and giving me songs that I cant just mark how much I hate them. And I have to sit through them because by the time I get to another song I used all my skips
1,If u want to listen to ads then its a perfect platform. Here u can listen to ads peacefully without disturbances but of course ull face some disturbances as they play song in between the ads. This is so annoying when I take rest I listen to ads but these songs disturb me thats why Im giving it 1 star rating. Hope u can fix this problem in ur upcoming updates so i can listen to ads peacefully without anymore song disturbances. Thank you :heart:
4,Its a really good app if you want to listen to music. the reason I gave four stars instead of five stars is because I thought that it was offline so that I could listen to it to music offline but it wasnt offline so.. but other than that its a really good app.
1,Its good but man can you improve the treatment for non premium users?? Like 2-3 ads after every track is annoying.Very disapointed.
5,Spotify is a wonderful way to disconnect From the world and connect with a universe filled with emotions feelings thoughts and a plethera of sounds all of your own making. Come and enjoy creation of your own with Spotify. Happy Travels. Good Speed.
1,Help. How do I stop spotify opening when I just want to play my own self recorded sound waves. It is wanting to be the default and it auto opens and them it doesnt even play the sound clip. So frustrating.
1,Frequent app crashes. Load up the app? Crash. Play a song? Crash. Try to switch to another app? Crash. Why even bother using this app.
4,I love this app its good when compared to other music apps. But the latest update doesnt allow me to hear my favorite songs. Just 2 or 3 of my favorite songs are played and then it plays recommended songs. It added some other songs too which related to my Playlists songs... The most bad thing in this is it shuffles songs which I added in order to my Playlist. It is really easy to use.
5,This app is my main source for music and podcasts and anything audio that I need. It is better than Amazon music. Im really considering giving Chinese New Year gifts of Spotify premium trials or month subscriptions to my closest family and my 2 best friends. I did the free trial and realized how much my life has been enriched by having excellent access to all of my audio entertainment all in one place. Developing an algorithm that reaches underground artist in mixed genres would be a godsend.
5,Its an amazing app and my favorite way to listen to music. The only thing that I dont like is how many features that they dont allow you to use without Spotify Premium.
3,Over the last few years the app just seems to get more buggy as more features were added. If you use Android Auto look for a better less buggy service. Audio catalog is still great.
2,There is only one single reason this gets a 2 instead of a 5 because it annoys me every single day. If I ask my Google home to play music on Spotify and then later on connect earbuds to my phone I dont want Spotify to suddenly switch to playing on my phone so that I can spent 2 minutes trying to recast it
1,If you are looking at getting this app then I recomend getting premium if you are going to use it enough to justify it the only problems you get are with the free version. The main problem I have found with Spotify is that Spotify adds random songs to you playlist and the only way to get rid of them is to hide them but this does not solve the problem nothing does seem to solve it. Spotify needs to do something about this. I am sure that I am not the only one with this problem.
3,Solid app overall but the Download to watch function isnt working on a Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Watch 4. A support post from September 2021 said this functionality was rolling out over the coming weeks but this obviously hasnt happened.
5,Works great and is overall a very fluid experience except for the ads those will get really annoying.
2,I really liked spotify at first but then it got updated or something and now it has gotten very annoying I cant enter my playlists to pick songs the only way I can listen to them is shuffle I also cant remove songs from my playlist so if that could be fixed Id rate higher.
1,Used Spotify as premium and non premium for a few years now... All of a sudden I get 6-8 ads (30 seconds per ad) every 2 or 3 songs.... Getting rather unbearable... Please sort this out.... Its getting a bit irritating... I dont mind a few ads or even 6-8 ads each 30min length but its 6-8 ads every 2-3 songs or approx 6-10 mins (song length dependant) Getting to the point of account closure and delete now.... Please fix it.
2,Im starting to hate Spotify you can only listen to like 2 of your songs unless you skip and then you get like 10 ads its really annoying
1,The past 2 days app wont load and when it finally does its sluggish. Please fix this I use this app to get me through work.
2,I really used to like this app but recently its been spamming me hard with ads. Seriously like almost after every song. I feel like they are really trying to get you to buy the Premium. Its a bummer because this app was my favorite to use for listening to music.
1,I am so mad that for the premium membership they added ads during podcasts. Isnt that what we are paying to not have? Pretty terrible and disappointing.
1,Okay so when I first downloaded this app I had no issues playing any music whatsoever but now I can only get little bits from a song when I click on it and I am forced to play shuffle on my playlist if I want to listen to my music and when I shuffle my songs I get played songs that arent even on my playlist Im not listening to a recommended even I just want to listen to my 16 songs that I play a lot but the fact that Im basically pushed into buying premium
2,It lags when you open the app and takes all day to get to the search function. Then when you do search it works fine but go to the main page likes or Playlists it just lags again.
5,Im not really one for these types of apps. You have gone way over and beyond any type of expectation I had towards spotify. You have music thats hard to find stuff thats slowly been lost through time - your programmers and analysts are doing a damn good job. Great BT car radio interaction and the drive with maps updates are great R60 a month easily paid
5,Great for finding new music since you cant pick specific songs. Dont forget to like the songs so they are saved and so you know the name
2,The app has issues updated my android and poof doesnt work everything on car comes up progress going no sound. They really need to update the app.
3,Ever since the new year my app will just stop playing with nothing else in the background and for no apparent reason. Please fix this. I will unsubscribe.
5,It is so fun and I really recommend Spotify however you do have to pay to get premium wich u can listen to music without ads and without Wi-Fi but overall GREAT awesome
4,I like Spotify lots of good music and interesting pods. But a couple of things could really be improved: first and most important- it is sometimes quite impossible to enjoy a classical piece with more than one movement since Spotify does not always play the movements in the correct order. This can be really irritating. Secondly: sometimes (actually mostly) information about the artists is missing. Who is conducting soloists orchestra etc. Quite valuable information that should be there.
5,I have had Spotify for 3 years now and with premium it is really good because you can listen ad free without having to be on the app my family uses the family plan and we all use and love it
5,I love to listen to music from the 60s both in English and Spanish I can get an excellent selection of the music I love from Spotify.
4,It isnt the most convenient if you are using it free. Lots of ads and cant select the song you want to hear. It only shuffles. If you pay the subscription its very useful. Make playlists easily can download for when your out of service area can find friends playlists and share music.
4,Solid app. Rarely crashes. Great features. Wish the free version wasnt shuffled
5,We were able to keep all our playlists when we changed phones and resubscribed with Spotify. It was a real bonus. We love the amount of music geared toward those easy listening and hip hop that we enjoy. Thank you very much for the good work!!! We are satisfied and happy to continue with Spotify.
2,I like all the variety of music you have on here however when I make a playlist and I usually have about 40 or 50 songs on there it keeps playing the same 5 or 10 songs over and over again without playing the other songs that are on my playlist that really sucks its no different than listening to the radio the idea was so I wouldnt have to listen to the same songs over and over again but this app plays the same music over and over again without playing every song in your playlist pointless
1,it plays one song and completely quits and now its not even playing my playlist and if im lucky it will play but it plays songs that arent in the playlist and arent even similar to my playlist. so here i am uninstalling AGAIN. it keeps giving like 4+ ads before playing one song and then it plays more ads and just completely quits. fix it its become horrible lately.
1,Spotify used to be so good but it barley works anymore. I dont want to have to pay to get basic features that used to be available to free users.
3,Spotify comes through with the music but there should be a close button or something if you dont force stop it stays forever fix that issue then we good
1,What a useless app! Unless you want to pay $10 a month the only thing youll be able to do here is create a playlist. You cant even change to the song you want to listen to! You only get 6 skips per hour! You cant change the order of the playlist unless you pay! And you get commercials between the songs! Crazy I rather deal with youtube. At least I can listen to what I want.
1,Latest release does not respond to Android Auto voice commands. Correction: sometimes it works. I dont engage Spotify tech support because past experience has been only a waste of time.
1,Seriously.. What have you done to this app. Nothing works anymore. I have to delete the app storage beforehand everytime I want to listen to music. And as soon as I minimize the app e.g. to answer a call or a text I have to close it and clear the storage again.. And log in again. Spotify became useless to me... And since this is going on for 3 weeks now and still has not been fixed I will unsubscribe from the premium plan. Done with it!
1,Loved it for podcasts until something changed and now it acts as the default player on my phone when I try to play audio files from my download storage. Worse it doesnt actually play the files! So bye bye spotify.
4,Please bring back car mode. I had to break out my ipod and download all my music so I dont have to open Google maps while driving (using data) to have it show what song is playing
5,Honestly cant stand free Spotify ( it probably doesnt bother everyone as much but oh my god for me I mightve deleted the app if I couldnt get premium:sob: ) but Spotify with premium I really enjoy everything there and use it pretty much everyday. I also like the for you weekly playlistsIve found so many new songs I really like off there.(+premium or not Spotify is still the best music/podcast app Ive been able to find ever imo)
2,Well the app is actually real good except for the annoying ads after 4-5 minutes. Every time after two songs play there comes whole 3 ads which just completely ruins the mood to enjoy some good music. Everyone cannot afford to have premium so its really not pleasing for people without premium to enjoy music here. Ads are okay but the amount of it...its really too much. Hope this matter gets looked over because I believe there are many users facing this same problem.
5,Its very sad that collecting CDs has gone away. But having premium Spotify allows me to have just about everything I could want without having to lug around my cd binder. Works great and have enjoyed it for many years now.
5,I love the app if I could rate it out of then Id say nine though the reason is because the ads are soo annoying but overall I like the app it has various options of music and you can find most songs that you want
2,I love the service but recently with these past few updates the app and the widget have been terrible. They no longer show whats actually playing until I close it out and clear the cache. And that fixes it for maybe an hour.
4,Great app. Would like to be able to turn off car mode so on road trips i can watch podcast as a passenger.
3,UPDATE: Its getting better. Keeps going back to start after ads... They interrupt podcasts with ads that used to only have ads at the beginning & end. In the middle of a very deep & sad story Spotify will interrupt with a lame ad that totally ruins the mood of the story. Finally getting Spotifys web player to work with Edge is a nightmare and its the ONLY player with that issue.
5,Extremely happy......and a suggestion to smoother the transition between two songs in a queue...... basically to make the time interval between two songs in a queue next to zero.........Otherwise very happy with Spotify......good experience
3,Great music server with a user friendly interface and great features but as a music lover that wants to hear the best possible quality sound it falls well short of other music servers. Spotify has by far the most comprehensive music library out there and if they got their act together and fulfilled what they said they would do by going CD quality with the sound then I would be far happier with the service and award it more stars. Excellent sound quality means so much to me so come on Spotify
1,Plays audio but the screen showing what is playing says nothing is playing. You cannot start or stop anything that is playing.
5,I love that this app shows you the lyrics and sometimes with videos too. I can also play my Spotify music on Alexa which makes it better. Spotify also plays music continually even without paying for subscription.
3,i recently switched from apple to android and i find spotify on android quite subpar. cant even queue songs by swiping. glitchy too sometimes like they dont rly care for android... quite disappointing
1,What is going on with Spotify lately.. my download isnt progressing at all... Ive got tones of space and clear cache.
1,I downloaded many podcasts but when Im offline they arent there half the time. Also they pay the band that wrote the song next to nothing. Garbage app for garbage music companies. Get music any other way
2,So I was listening to my Spotify playlist and I have it in a certain order so that it isnt jumbled. I was listening to a song in my playlist and then it skipped two songs in my playlist and played another song which I knew wasnt next. I check my playlist and tried putting the skipped songs on but it only letter me listen to previews of the songs in my playlist. I dont know why its doing this and its frustrating! The whole reason why I made my playlist is so songs arent everwhere :/
3,I love the service and use it almost daily. Its the app I take issue with. There are near constant problems and bugs. I cant count the number of times I have had to delete the cache log out log back in discover that hasnt solved the problem delete the cache log out update my prl update my profile restart my phone log in still buggy clean un-and-reinstall the app� etc. If this was a free service Id say I get what I pay for but Im a paying subscriber.
3,I normally love this!!! Its life!!! BUT lately it cuts out all the time. I have to touch the screen on my phone for it to turn back on. Wildly frustrating! I hope this is just a temporary problem!
1,App gets stuck in endless loop of ads. I have to restart the app just to listen to music again.
1,I cant get access easily to the songs that I want to listen to When I press play it play a different song than what I chose!
5,I have used both Napster and Amazon music. I have to say that I find Spotify to be the better app. I love the fade feature more importantly the car safety feature. Only grumble I have is I wish it had more equalizer functions like concert etc. . Awesome app!! Very happy!@
5,Perfect app. Great stability and streaming. I have been a Premium member for a year and Spotify does not disappoint ^-^
4,Fairly good service I just wish there was less ads. I do not mind listening to them but 4 ads after each song is excessive for me.
4,Good. I always like the app. But the reason I gave 4 stars coz of the ads. They are too much ads that force for premium pls give a minimun of those. Otherwise its fantastic
5,I love this app so simple to use and store all your favorite music :notes: ! I just wish they had a yearly subscription instead of paying monthly.
3,this app is amazing for listening to music but their is a problem. everytime I try to listen to my playlist a random song starts playing and after like 4 song I can finally listen to my playlist.
5,Stopped using YouTube and went to Spotify. Far less ads the music is organized and easy to focus on single artists or genres.
1,No longer lists the songs in an album in a scrollable list like before only five or six in paragraph style. The same thing for playlists. No longer lists the top songs for an artist. Awful!!
3,Amazing app to listen songs like not amazing but bestest But even if I say lets not talk about ads yet I would complain for it like its dude too many ads after every 3 songs thats duh! Sorry for the 3 star rating cause if the ads sruff doesnt change then my rating wont too humbly saying thanks:)
4,I love this app. The only thing it is lacking is an adventuresomeness button. Id like to be able to indicate to the app how adventuresome I feel each day which would tell the algorithm to surprise me or keep me safely in my audio comfort zone.
1,All ops are great except one. Whenever I try to search for an artist it will disappear apparently and saying (Something wrong).
5,Five stars all day long best layout for a music streaming app. You can filter the playlists anyway you want to alphabetically by title is my favourite. Ill update in a month or 2 when I have upgraded to the family plan!
5,Ive been using Spotify for years now and I love it. All the music I need is here and I have been enjoying prime student.
1,If you are a music lover but cant purchase premium membership then please dont ever think of downloading it cuz there are 1000s of ads and not like spotify lite this version shows 4 ads of 30sec together which are not skipable... Please @Spotify reduce the ads count or reduce the ads time but please do something :broken_heart:
1,This would be great but why does Spotify tell me to watch an ad for 30 minutes of uninterrupted ad-free music and then show an ad 10 minutes later
5,Personally I think this app is way better than pandora. Been using Spotify for over two years and the range of music just seems to get better and better. So thank you for creating it. :ok_hand:
5,Pretty cool app. But it would be better if the adds were reduced. Also its better if you provide the original thing. You know sometimes I feel the original voice of a song is different from what you provide in the app.
1,I prefer everyone to Choose :heart:? resso :heart:?.. Beacause First of all Spotify was working amazingly!! After sometimes when I open the app it says internet connection is not available am I look like a fool and this app without turning on the internet connection this app is getting waster and waster and waster..... Please choose :heart:?resso:heart:?
5,THIS music app is amazing i use this app from 7 month and not send me wrote notifications and any sing this app use very low ammount internet for play any music I love this thing I this way I play nonstops music contiusely and one amazing thing you no go anytime in search bar for music because if u like a song it show on your loby automatically and many things to see like. Stories. Cast related books for listening it work very faster for add new music in this app. I wish in nest update add stori
5,My personal rating and use experience. I enjoyed listening to music from Spotify. I give it 5 Stars because an app that does this good for you deserves nothing less. Keep up the good work to the workers behind the scenes. Its good work and it is noticeable to us!!! :notes: :musical_note: :black_square_for_stop:
5,Its such a good app I just l:purple_heart:VE it im and army and k-pop fan I can listen song very clearly and good quality it doesnt require more data also its a good app :grin::v::heart::purple_heart: and one drawback is that it plays ads for every two songs its just *trusfating*:eye_roll: rather than that I just l?VE this app:blush:
4,Ive been using premium for 1.5yrs now. Its great. Only issue is the app whenever a new update rolls out I get new problems such as: the app getting slow not loading in or not connecting with my pc. All these problems I can fix by restarting the app but it gets tedious after 2 months on consistent problems.
1,lacks basic features if you dont pay. cant even listen to a single song without having to skip through an unnecessarily auto generated playlist only to run out of hourly skips? pathetic
1,Stop forcing podcasts to be exclusive. Nobody wants to be forced into your service. I was on the fence about trying Spotify but now I will not.
4,The app is great. I would give it five Stars if there was a way to skip and then six times. Another then that it is a great app to Liston to music on. It was the only app that I found that worked at school.
3,Great app but limits mobile features behind a subscription love using Spotify on my computer cause I can loop playlist and begin the playlist with whichever song Im feeling at the time but with mobile you cant loop playlists or play specific songs without paying for Spotify premium which for 10$ a month those miniscule features just arent worth it imo personally I dont care for ad free listening
4,It has virtually EVERY song I want only a select few I have to go to YouTube for so its a really convenient app to have if youre a music junkie!
4,App is great! I do wish that it could automatically detect wifi/data usage and switch to offline mode accordingly. Its a pain to frequently manually turn on offline mode
2,Great app except when I like a selection it ops in every song radio I add. It doesnt matter if its a different genre of music. Everything I like or listen to frequently spears on every song radio I try to listen too. How can I find new music if the app makes me listen to the same song in every playlist
5,Now if only I could figure out the repeat option :shrug|type_5:???. Sure some of my libraries arent too long but Id be nice if it kept playing instead of stopping after 1 play through.
4,Experience is good. Good UI only problem is if youre not on an auto-renewal subscription when it ends all the downloaded songs get deleted even after you subscribe again.
1,I pay for Spotify premium and I still get ads when I listen to my podcasts or music. Not worth the $10 a month for that. Really unhappy with the app.
1,There is actually no way to see all songs from an artist as the songs they were featured on are not in their discography. The Appears on section is not organized by release date its a jumbled mess so songs are impossible to find there. Same as with all other features like light mode or Release Radar that doesnt delete itself every week Spotify decided to screw what users want and do nothing to improve their experience. I honestly dont know a single app that would hate its userbase more than Spotify does.
2,The app is nice and easy to use but it doesnt show the lyrics tab. Ive tried re-installing the app but the problem still persist. Please fix this. The lyrics still doesnt show up!
3,I just love the app intreface... app is awesome in every aspect ratio of multi window in my tab. But tanglish lyrics ( tamil song in english lyric ) are so so so bad worst tanglish lyrics. Tamil ( lyrics in tamil ) lyrics are good. Please fix it.. Because spotify has best playlists than any other app and it has negligible ads. PLEASE FIX THAT LYRICS PART!!!
5,I have used spotify for ever! I love it so much it is great for podcasts when I walk and ofc music is a wide variety...100% recommend
4,Everything is good about this app.. Especially the dedicated playlists thing but the extremely frequent ads are such a headache.. Not everyone all the time can afford a premium subscription so please be a little understanding and dont line up ads more than songs...
2,I would say its a great app but why the hell is changing the music a premium feature shouldnt that be the bare minimum for any music app? Its pretty scummy to make people pay for something that should be a basic feature and lets not forget the random crashes.
2,I have had to uninstall and reinstall multiple times in the past month. The app freezes and suddenly no longer works with my Android Auto. Now I cant even get it to play at all.
5,Most recent/ listened to stuff right at the top as you open the app so you can just jump straight it. Simple and brilliant.
1,Garbage absolute garbage if its been multiple hours it should have give you more than six skips and yet again it doesnt let you pick a specific song from your playlist to play
1,Difficult to cancel the subscription. I cannot not get into my other account. And they wont cancel my subscription. They should let cancel directly on the app. Never again!!!
1,Used this app a lot but one day it stopped working. I couldnt play any songs or even open any playlist. I logged out and logged back in but it didnt work and even reinstalled it I even cleared my storage and cache and updated the app but the problem still remains. Its been a month or so but no matter what I do the app is not responding.
1,This app is real fantastic but more than songs there are Ads. Should I listen ads or songs sometimes I think that is this song app or ads what should I do. But this app is really fantastic I love it. I think this app should have a award of (MOST ADS ARE IN THIS APP MORE THAN SONGS). There are only some ads are playing but whenever I play songs they play ads is there is compulsory to get premium. please try to understand in few few minutes they play ads
5,Ive had an amazing experience with Spotify especially with buying Premium and removing ads. A great app highly recommended.
4,Great content app has improved a lot as well. The lyrics addition has taken this to another level.
1,to he honest I really hate the new update now! I cannot skip songs I cannot play the songs at the parts I like to- whats all this? Not everyone cant afford to get premium why do have to do like that?
5,Spotify is naturally an amazing music platform. Their library is lovely and youre hard pressed to find something not available even given the copyright issues with international releases. The UI is fantastic and highly responsive. As a premium user Ive nothing but praise to be honest.
4,Spotify is very good for streaming and for discovering nes music. The user interface is lacking. I would suggest zlidong down to go back in the now playing view.
3,My favourite app but thing I miss the most is having details about why the artist wrote the song song meaning facts about the artist etc lyrics are great feature but would prefer to choose what I want. Had this app for nearly 10 years in premium and I love it but that change is why I gave it 3 stars and not 5
5,It is a very interesting app. It allows me to find songs that are very old and also the latest ones. I surely recommend this app to be used as a music player.
2,The app is so absolutely slow most of the time it doesnt show connection to the WiFi and I receive the offline mode. Again its super slow especially when I open it on the bus I have to wait 10 mins before it works. With everything I pay every month this is unacceptable so please fix
1,The new update is annoying. It just doesnt play the song that I want to listen to at once because of that shuffle thingy.
2,I use this mainly for podcasts but the interface keeps getting stuck on an episode on the lower control bar and I cant control what Im listening to. Normally then I have to reinstall. It only sorts it for a couple of days at max.
1,App keeps crashing have uninstalled and reinstalled to no avail. Will be cancelling my premium as its not worth it right now at all when the app freezes you cant change playlist or song then shuts down and crashes. This has been happening for the past couple of weeks now.
5,Its one of a kind among others. Its probably the best out there but the payment system at least in Nigeria is fraught with lots of difficulties. Ive been trying to pay for the premium package since last December to no avail.
1,Honestly the apps greedy. You have to listen to a whole playlist to just listen to ONE song. You have to pay for premium for it. And it has loadsss of ads its so unjoyable now.. Pls fix this madness bro u cant even listen to music w out PAYING
1,It jumbed up all of my song in my playlist and you only 6 skips per hour!? Thats genuinely stupid soon Im going to get premium but if that doesnt help then Im gonna go back to Amazon Music.
2,I installed this app in strating 2 weeks it was amazing but today as i opened itit was not working properly and was not able to use Internet even i installed it again but it has not opened and not worked properly!!!!!
1,it always says No Internet Connection even when i have my internet on. and when i tried to unfollow some artists my following numbers doesnt decrease and stays the same. like i even unfollowed everyone but still nothing. i already tried everything and nothing changes. this new update is just so annoying.
1,I think there is no use of playlists that we make coz the other songs which i dont have in my Playlist plays next.... There are lots and lots ads... OMG.... :flushed: Few days after downloading the app it was working well but later on it became worst.... Idk y the song stops in between and suddenly starts playing other songs which arent there in my Playlist tooo i want Spotify to improve in terms of that songs getting stopped in the middle. Please do look upon these matters. A very frustrating app:sleepy:
5,I really love this app. It has a wide selection of music and podcasts to choose from. I also like that the payment plans for premium are varied and one can comfortably choose a plan that works for them.
5,I am just in love with this app all the functionalities added in this are really so thoughtful and impressive specially all the sorting of the songs and can listen with your friends also on which device the song playing and quality of music collection everything is just awesome.Kudos to the app team!!
4,Best app but I think spotify should add karako of all song in app for better singing experience. .... Over all app is best for song If you take paid verson your experience is more majedarr. Thats all form my side ...
5,My app is restarting my playlist from the very beginning instead of continuing. (Ex. I can play a song in the middle of the playlist and once that song goes off itll jump back to the first song of that playlist) smh Has been doing this for the past 2 weeks and its getting old. I just uninstalled and reinstalled the app back but still....the SAME THING!!!!! UPDATE: The app had been working fine over a year now. Maybe it was something wrong with the app.
1,So bad because after I listen a song there a add one after every song and so I think gonna app is better than spotify app for listening songs . I am so much disappointed and frustrated by this add . Please change this Galicia.
1,Possibly the most counter intuitive and useless user interface I have seen on an app. From colour scheme to positioning of icons it is all wrong.
5,Its just the best music app... Different playlists according to your taste..just how you listen...This app just knows you very well and wont stay behind in impressing you
4,I recently migrated from YT music. I really enjoy it but unfortunately theres no way to upload your own mp3 files that I cannot find on the service. At least up to 50 tracks would be OK Would be nice to have this feature added in the future.
5,Very Happy with the Spotify music app lots of great features and music and podcasts to choose from.
2,spotify was always good but now unless u have premium its tough to even open the app. They say if i listen to a video ad i will have uninterupted music but that does not work now like how it used to work before. The ads come after 2-3 ads and sometimes even after each ad please fix the ad or atleast fix the policy
1,Playlist are virtually useless since it floods the songs you want with random garbage and doesnt let you choose your preferred song. Its just so money grabbing. Only way to use this app is through premium.
3,Its a nice music app but when I play a song like beliver it plays a suggested song and it says playing. Please fix this and this would be my favorite music app. I would give 5 stars.
3,Ill say its the best app to listen songs but the ads are so annoying:tired_face: so Ill suggest you guys to get premium before they start the ads but you guys should download it.
5,Very good so far. I can find any song i like and also different language easy to find and hear favourite song at the same time as i do my work i love it. Doing paper work is stressful and music really get rid of stress i will give it 50 stars
4,It would be better when flicking through playlists if you leave one list and then went back to it it took you to the last song you were playing. Same as when you search a song if you could play it from a play list and then continue playing from that play list.
4,I dont know if its just me but since November last year more than half of my followings disappeared from my friend activity. Im sure as heck they dont use private session. I asked my friends if they were having the same problems and turns out they do too.
1,Spotify gas stopped casting to other devices and does play on Tvs where I have it loaded. Email has been sent to the Support who I hope can respond and fix quickly
5,Awesome app! Almost every artist and almost every song from every artist. Its great being able to save stuff for listening to later and making personal playlists 10/10 :ok_hand|type_1_2:
1,The app pauses every 10 mins when I listen to podcasts. Its really frustrating especially when Im driving in the car. Fix your app!!
1,Way too many adds says 30 mins add free than adds every 5 mins plays same 20 songs on repeat when playlist has plenty to choose from may aswel listen to main stream radio waste of time unless your going to pay for primium but considering it lies to you on free mode dont trust it
3,Love the service but I hate the app! I am waiting for minutes to play even downloaded podcasts to the point that phone just shuts app or I just give up waiting ! Playing stops randomly  I am listening to advertising even after paying membership. After every update I am hoping it gets fixed but it never does...
2,I used to love Spotify... I have premium and as I am an hour out of town and for the largest part of my drive there is no radio reception so this has been my in car music. Just before Christmas my phone died and I discovered that a lot of Spotify users - notably ppl who use phones that are not Samsung or Apple - have been able to make Spotify work properly in their cars for up to a year. I am appalled at the lack of customer service and suggest paying for a different app unless they fix this.
5,Describe my experience ? Ive been able to find all the songs I selected. Great app. Jan.11/22 I thought I was a bona fide aficionado of rap circa 1995 but it seems I have alot to learn from Spotify besides the legendary KRS-ONE this music application is my new teacer
4,The app is good but I did not out 5 stars because for some reason I can no longer loop songs. I wish there was more that I could do WITHOUT having to pay in order to do simple things..
5,I havent been in the business of reviewing apps but Spotify might be my favorite thing. Only thing I wanna see is a button to shuffle through a folder of playlists like you see on the computer version.
5,I am not a big fan of any advertising other than that I really enjoy the variety of artist and listening to my favorite songs of my past and present artists I was gifted an AQURBOOST BOOM speaker for Xmas which I use to accompany Spotify this 5 star app. Thank you and bless you.
2,I just installed the new update and when I got into spotify to listen to my old songs they all changed I tried to find the original ones but they were gone why did this happen? This update ruined everything every song I liked got randomized and led me to a diffrent song I had no idea about and that is not a good thing. You screwed up and Im going to a diffrent app
5,The thing I like most about Spotify is the algorithm that suggests new artists and music it thinks you will like based off your preferences. It seems to know your musical taste even better than you do yourself! I use the discover weekly playlist to get new artists and songs based on my musical interests!
5,Everything on music thats this app. You want it itll find and play regardless to content in any culture and language pod cast needs slight improvement. Other the that it gets a big thumbs up:+1::+1::clap::grin:
5,I like it because if you turn off the device you can continue listening to your favorite music and go to other pages in the same way you can continue listening and the offers are great :+1:
2,Fix the bloody fwd rwd buttons they dont work when my phone is locked and I know its happening to others too. It also gets stuck on a song or podcast on the screen but its playing another. It stays stuck for a few minutes then freaks out shuts down and you have to reopen. Im really considering moving to Deezer. I pay for premium but still get the in-podcast apps that I then cant easily fwd through without unlocking my screen.
5,what can I say...its almost like Im cracking my head to find bugs but there is almost none except for the fact that Id really like to see no. of streams on every song. And also I find it difficult to upgrade to a paid plan it rejects my Mastercard sometimes.
5,No doubt the only music streaming app worth paying for the premium service. No second thoughts coming from an audiophile and fan of any and all genres across the board. Love discovery and love revisiting old and nearly forgotten faves as quick as I can search. Run-on sentence? Sorry Mrs. McGuckin you old hag!
1,This app sucks balls. No search function which makes finding podcasts on a channel an huge waste of time. The last thing listened to just sits at the bottom of the app and can not be dismissed. Both of those bugs are a deal breaker.
2,So I have a subscription and up until about two months ago Ive been having serious issues with Spotify losing connection even though I have full bars. Got a brand new phone problems even worse. Must be Spotify. Please get this fixed.
5,Its a really nice app if u ask me. I can listen to all the songs I want. I mean there are some songs that are not available but in general they have everything.
4,Rating this as a Premium user and I love it! They ALMOST have every song I want and offer sizable podcast interesting contents. My mom is a a free user... and its a different story. She gets frustrated with limited shuffle and search option. Weighing that slightly in and the few annoying times they would suddenly change interface I cant give a solid 5 star.
1,Application is getting worse even premium. Songs stop playing randomly screens doesnt show the current song.
3,There are so many adds it says you can have 30 minutes without adds more like 10 minutes. And when I look up a song it takes me to a play list. Other than that its a pretty good app
5,Great music selection! Spotify includes hard to find groups and genres like niche folk music from little known regions. I like that theres a free version of the app with friendly quirky ads :)
2,Music keeps stopping mid song mid play list. Please fix. Still very buggy. Podcasts play in weird orders display on the screen does not reflect whats playing.
4,A good app with one annoying element - on an album individual track versions are frequently different to the original album. Suspect this is to save storage space by keeping only one version of each song. This doesnt acknowledge though the work that typically goes into crafting an album and it contents by the artists.
5,Been a premium subscriber for many years. Spotify is hands down the best music streaming service Ill never use anything else.
1,Jan2022 update is terrible! seems like Spotify wont play in background and always pauses until i reopen app to resume or freezes and have to restart podcasts fml!! Ive checked my settings and it should work in background worked great before last update! :(
1,Im surprised that I couldnt use my gift card to buy premium please add Gift cards or Google play or apple to buy premium. Instead of using a credit card. Please and thank you.
1,Not happy :rage::eye_roll::neutral_face:. The app wants everyone to buy music and then listen to it. Please :pray: make this app the app that I used to love :heart:? and listen to for hours. If this problem isnt fixed soon Ill just delete the app completely. So please fix this app. Id be really greatfull if this is fixed as soon as possible. :blush: Thanks.
5,I dont think I have ever run into a problem with Spotify itself I use It to stream all my music and the sound quality you get with premium is way worth it
1,Ever since the recent updates the app has acting up the previous songs name and album art remains in the notifcation bar while the next song plays. Most of the times i cant even pause or change the song from the lock screen as I cant see anything. Weird please fix. I am a paying customer and do not appreciate using such a pathethic app.
2,Playlists dont function properly. Even when I download an episode it wont play without a strong internet connection. Very resource heavy for bandwidth. UI is mediocre at best. If they didnt own Rogan I wouldnt use them.
3,Adds random songs to my playlist. I wanted a really short one and it added 10 more. Cannot play song individually.
2,Bought premium still receive ads when listening to podcasts - whats the point !? App often just stops loading content and gives a black screen despite good internet connection. App often incorrectly shows an old song as currently playing when Im hearing something different - this means I cant correctly pause/play/skip songs. Has been a frustrating experience overall and only reason I still use it is because no real viable competitors for now. Will review rating if issues addressed.
1,I STILL cannot get lyrics to work. I contacted support weeks ago to no avail. Ill update this when I get lyrics but as someone paying for premium I think its rediculous to still not have the feature Edit: Ive now contacted support 4 times with no avail still. Free users have this feature when I still do not.
2,Really well developt app easy 5 star rating. Sometimes after the update app forgets log in details so I need to put them manually. Edit: app crashes constantly.
4,Very good overall never had any major problems. couple of minor issues like songs (very rarely) continuing in silence after they finish but that could just be a glitch caused by my bad internet lol
4,UX could be improved a bit - I dont wanna wait one second every time I click on the 3-dots icon for the song options. Spotify checks for an active internet connection just to grey out some options from that menu and it ruins the experience. AND THIS HAPPENS EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE OFFLINE MODE ENABLED!
5,I have been using this app since around 2018 and I would say it is pretty good I dont have any complains. I dont have premium cause Im just not going to pay for it but I dont mind the ads either so yea.
1,Sucks always buffering and it eats up my data unlike Pandora. Fast forward to song in the middle of the song Im listening to.
4,Amazing app I can hear any song I want but the latest update I cant skip or choose the song I want.
1,Guess you didnt want my honest review thanks for deleting you creeps. This app would be fine if it werent for the inescapable unpredictable ads I listen to music to calm down and this app causes more distress than its worth at least on YouTube I can listen to the songs I want and can skip ads.
4,I like to use this app for songs because I can play music while looking at other apps saves my favorite music makes a Playlist off what I like which I loves that and it works for me
1,Fix your App Spotify on Android TV Sucks. Freezes up device completely forcing a reboot is only solution.
4,Its very good and probably my most used app. Trouble is I cant find how to access lyrics. I have premium and I just deleted and reinstalled the app in hope it would work. Please could someone help me if possible?
3,It aright my only issue is using the option for cars. It doesnt tell you how to use it and it sucks because using bluetooth decreases the audio quality
5,Using Spotify Premium Duo. Love that I can download Playlists to listen to on the go without needing data and that my bf can have his own joined account for a minimal price difference. Would recommend for anyone / couples out there that love discovering and sharing music!
5,My personal experience with Spotify is awesome and I would not change a thing and I love the fact that my family can also enjoy wonderful and joyful keep up the good work
5,Love the options to see the Playlist. Sometimes I am not close to my technology to rate a song while playing later am able to swipe to see what just played and click on the heart.
1,The now playing screen is stuck on a previously played podcast it doesnt show you what is actually playing.
3,Tells u to listen to video and u will get 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening then 3 minutes later plays 2 or 3 more commercials. Puts songs in my favorites that I did not select for my favorite. Otherwise a good app. App may b better if u pay for it. My complaints r on the free version.
4,I love this app I use it for gaming sleeping and at school but I dont know why the songs dont play in order for some reason it used to and now it wont that kinda makes me mad cause I want to listen to my songs in order either way great app
5,New to Spotify and love it. If you are thinking of subscribing and you are a music lover do it. Its amazing...
4,Dislike that many older bands music isnt easily found or available especially in old punk genre or old metal from 80s-90s and old skool is also hard to find much selection its mostly newer music available
2,Why the hell full screen album art on lock screen was made mandatory? It should be optional. It makes the lock screen more ugly. Please fix this. We users are asking to fix this issue for years and you guys are not even listening to us. Really disappointed with Spotify team :-1:
1,Whatever they did in the latest update ruined the app. It doesnt show the music Im playing anymore its just stuck showing the last place in a podcast I was at when I updated. Dumb.
1,Spotifys service is great but its a shady business model and it doesnt pay artists enough. This review will remain 1 star until Spotify starts paying artists.
5,Easy to use especially searching songs in relation to themes. I love the fact that most of the artist I know are accessible.
2,Fix the app Spotify!! The player keeps showing the previous podcast I have played and does not show the accurate time stamp of the show. Was listening to Joe Rogan on one of his episodes for about an hour and the player shows that it is at 4 minutes. Then it randomly jumps to another episode while it displays the name of the episode I was just listening to.
5,I love this app so much because it has all of my favorite songs and the lyrics are the best! Even if you arent using the lyrics the lyrics goes with the song!
1,One of the best apps... but I extremely suggest the developer to reduce ads because they irritate the coustomer like hell... If at all it a product ad then it can be seen but no only one slogen take Spotify premium . I mean what the hell is this  most of the students do have money so what they do ?? So I suggest reduce the premium ads... Not the complete ads but only the premium ads ...
1,You cant choose what songs you listen too ads come on lealry after every 2 songs very very bad aswell as most songs dont work! Moving too soundcloud
3,Im having a problem... when i try to open mp3 files stored on my phone spotify opens instead of the file ive tried every way i could find on the faqs and support pages
3,Hate your ads need better search engine cant be accurate always not everybody has money to go premium or please change those actors and the idea of irritating annoying script for ads it is not funny as you think it is.
1,Seriously Spotify u dont have proper shuffling for multiple playlist in queue. I guess its timeto move on from Spotify. Really awful.
5,Great library. The sharing option is convenient. I continue to spend many carefree hours listening to my favorite music and continue to find more previously unknown (to myself) songs and artists thanks to the recommendations.
2,UPDATED 1/11/22: for podcasts: current pod playing does not match whats actually playing. It stays on a previously played item. Also it has been turning on randomly even when not in use.. ??? I REALLY LOVE THE CONTENT ON THIS APP- PLEASE FIX!! Cons: Cant customize sleep timer. Cant re-order Your Episodes list. -if there is a way to do these things and I just havent figured it out pls lmk.
5,Nice app for listening songs but only disturbing is ads just 5to 7 songs Ad will come and next number songs playing this is the thing in the app is small disturb but the app is so good to use in traveling
5,Love Spotify. I can listen to music I never knew existed. Spotify has opened my ears to some amazing new music. Thanks Spotify!
5,Awesome variety of music! I actually like Spotify more than Pandora! If I could give Spotify a higher rating I would give it a perfect 10!!!!
5,So far so good really enjoying it. Had since late December 21 and already around 300 plus songs. Play on shuffle phone to Bluetooth speakers or ps4 to TV surround. Can control from phone. Its a vibe. No complaints so far!
5,Whenever there is a new update  everytime spotify starts crashing..... shows songs are playing but no sound and I have tried various methods but I didnt succeed in repairing it
2,I dont know why i cant skip songs to one that i like. Its really sad that we have to pay to SKIP A FREAKING SONG. Please do better. I dont enjoy listening to music on spotify anymore :confused:
1,I would give the app a higher rating score but im a mobile spotify user and for some reason i cant listen to the songs i want when i create a playlist i can just listen to a random shuffled song that the app decides to give me to listen to and i think the playlists are broken Also when i do try to listen to my playlist songs and i click on one of them just a small short sample of the song starts playing and not the full versioni just want to be able to listen to the full songs in my playlist
3,got new bluetooth headphones and for some reason when i play listening with them it constantly like skips every few seconds but only in specific places in my house. and i tested it on other apps but this problem only happens when im on spotify. which is a big issue for me cos i listen to music a lot when im doing anything. so cooking or washing the dishes while my music skips constantly is unbearable. please help me fix this issue.
1,Barely ever works on home computer. Songs play for minutes with no sound. I spend more time trying to play music then listen to music. Phone app works good but dont always want to use phone app. I think Ill be dropping Spotify for Apple Music or Amazon Music.
2,Whats wrong with the lyrics feature? Like except me everyone in my circle is having that feature! And like I have tried everything... reinstalled logged in and out even its always updatedstill what the heck is wrong with this app?
4,I added 4 Star cause I can only find playlist of songs and cant even find them even the most famous ones and I cant skip the song to another alot for 6 hours in playlist please fix this
5,Very easy to use get any band any album and any song I can think of I can always find it on spotify very pleased with my subscription with them
3,HmmThe app is just great. But why 3 stars? The reason being ads after every 2 songs. Thats very annoying and forces to download any other app. :unamused:
2,The app is although good but when i installed it again i tried to hear song but it was not starting and playlist was also not opening plz solve this issue or i will again uninstall it it is my warning okay :rage::grimacing::triumph:.
5,I enjoy listening my music in Spotify. My only but is that the random selection of music is not the best with songs played many times
5,Spotify is awesome! I havent found any song yet that I dont have access to. The app is so easy to use and making playlists couldnt be easier or more fun. Highly recommend a monthly subscription to this app! 5 stars!!
3,I choose a song it keeps shuffling to a different song and I cant switch it off please fix this. It also does this when Im in a playlist.
2,Last update sucks now the song wont display on my radio thats playing. The song plays on the speaker my phone is connected to my car but it wont display the song extremely frustrating.
5,Just loving it :heart_eyes::heart::two_hearts::sparkling_heart:.....seems like it just made for me:hand_with_index_and_middle_fingers_crossed:.....it have Many options also like the time capsule And also shows the current trending famous Indian and international :musical_note:...so I can easily get the name of the song which where famous and trending in the apps like insta..and short videos app:innocent:.......best app i ever saw.......:kissing_closed_eyes: It would be like a cherry on cake if it can give free downloading on songs....but what to do bcoz it is impossible....I hope that it could be possible one day:heart:
3,Can you please fix the podcast ad? Its disturbing everytime i want to search some music or re open the app some random podcast ad keep popping up. Thanks
2,I dont know if its a bug or something wrong in my phone but when I listen songs (Particularly nature sounds like rain) the ads sound comes after combines with that sound. I dont know why its happening. Please fix this thing.
4,I find this much easier to use than Pandora. I can actually find my playlist with less clicking.
5,Use this app everyday and have been for years. I like that I can create plsylists & share them. It is definitely worth getting the subscription. I use it for running & workouts. Ive never had any issues even when I change phone. Would recommend :+1:
1,Another bug !!! 11/1/22 Already add music to my liked song from my phone than i cant find that song in my liked album in my spotify tablet. even my phone and tab doesnt sync playing now !!!! hate it soooo much. and seems like my spotify tablet disconnected totally to internet *offline. I dont want to uninstall or reset the apps cz im on cellular now it will gonna be so much data need to re download the whole my liked songs !!!!! WORST !!!! even apple music play so much clear song ssssht
5,Its a tiny bit slow at times but otherwise great. I love the download feature for when Im driving and offline:heart_eyes:
1,Everytime I use spotify with my mobile data it will work at first but halfway through it will stop. Ive turned on and off the mobile data but it still doesnt work. My music jamming is constantly ruined
2,Initial impressions were great. No ads although I would not have minded. Spotify made accurate recommendations and I created a Playlist. I could cue songs and see the whole playlist to select songs. Back online a few days later and the functionality is suddenly limited...even skipping tracks is now a premium feature. So youre sucked in with free features that just disappear and become premium. Misleading or what?
3,It is a good app that i use multiple times a day but after every song i get an ad i am never allowed to skip any songs and despite what i changed in settings every second song is completely random.
1,After years Im still having the same problem of my downloading music switching storage. It has now happened over 10 times in just over 2 weeks Im done with this app
1,Whats point in disabling songs from platform even after were listening more advertisements than songs. Just forcing to go for premium. Too cheap marketing.
1,Stops playing after one track??? Have to close and restart app to make it play again. Why??? I had to log out of app and delete from my phone and reinstall to fix the issue. This resulted in me losing all my downloads?! On a Pixel 5? If you cant get it right on vanilla Android when are you ever going to get it right?! RUBBISH!!!!!!
5,Spotify is the best streaming service there is. You can download playlists play songs over and over again or choose them all for free. My favourite part is the fact that you can create your own music. I like how you can follow artists so that you get notified when they drop a song. Spotify is smart enough to suggest songs you would like based of your listening and what artists you follow. At the end of the year Spotify reviews your listening with wrapped. This is a fun look back at your year.
3,Not that bad but could throw some adds out like when u listen to a song the adds dont come on for an hour or 2 to distrupt the good feeling of the music from spotify
1,The music or podcast episodes whatever I was listening would suddenly stop and the app would restart by itself. Which is quite annoying.
1,Ads are killing the experience. First ad says get 30 mins ad free music after ad. Then five mins later another ad pops up. There is either a technical glitch in your push ads or this is done deliberately. Either ways its not a pleasant experience. I have immediately switched to Wynk.
4,Great app good recommendations for music discovery as well as my music taste. I love the continuity in switching between devices this was the main deciding factor compared to other apps. However the device continuity is very unstable 25% of the times Spotify will not detect correctly the other device Ill be playing on causing mix ups on the Playlist control which is quite frustrating.
5,This is the best ever app to use! We can do other work while listening to music! It helps especially when Im in a mood to talk to my friends and to listen to music at the same time! It also helps when Im scrolling on BTS Photos on Google :joy::joy:. 100% recommend this app!
5,Everything on the app is good except advertising. For that Im continuously applying for the premium but everytime payment is getting failed.
3,Lately when it connects to my car the app stops working altogether and doesnt show anything after the first song. This happens when connected via blue tooth.
3,Great streaming app....except there are a great number of tracks that arent available or arent available offline even when downloaded.
3,Too many ads. Not able to enjoy the songs...too many ads are coming when compared to other apps..Please reduce the frequency of playing Ads.
5,Its just so great :+1: the amount of wonderful types of music :notes: at your fingertips and listening to the immaculate playback each time you go into a different genre without any problems or hassle at all. Spotify is 100% for me!!
5,Ive heard songs remembering Good memories and good new songs of all types of music. Magnificent theyve made feel more comfortable and relaxed. Good clear sounds like Feel it flowing throughout my body.
2,When I started using this app is was all good night after some time it suddenly stopped showing me the price of the songs. Worst service i got.
4,Good other than the fact that Ill have my Spotify app completely closed and nothing playing and it will randomly start playing music from a random playlist. I dont have Google assistant or anything so its not an accident through that. It randomly just starts playing music.
4,I like Spotify. I spend most of last year listening to it. I wish that ALL albums Compilations and other songs that arent available in the United States to be available to listen to.
3,Tbh this was a great app but the number of recommended songs that come up when youre just trying to listen to your liked songs is extremely annoying like I get it we get to listen to new songs but I dont want 5 recommend songs coming up one after another and I dont like it or smth and cant skip songs at the end I just give up and go on YouTube to listen to music.
1,Even after paying a premium subscription Spotify STILL advertises podcasts (as banners pop-ups and guaranteed middle of the home screen podcast recommendations. **Well thats not so bad! At least theyre doing som**-- Wait theres more! Many podcasts pre-recorded their own advertisements AND theres advertisements plugged into these podcasts BY SPOTIFY ontop of it all. Its disgusting youve already got a monthly rate. Also the computer browser and application is never updated significantly!!
1,Bugs bugs Before going for Spotify premium i thought its the best music app but after going for premium i experienced that theres bugs in every corner of the app dont know how they dont fix errors like - App showing no internet even when you have a good connection. Do developers even use thier own app:thinking:
1,Garbage just straight trashcan dl it for Rogan and the majority of the time it doesnt load the podcast at all then when it does itll play whatever episode it wants :face_vomiting: it happens on both my phones z fold 2 and s20+ both 5g..... sooo annoying... update still sucks 1/27/2021... 5/26/21 still garbage... 10/27/21 still trash... 11/1/21 went to commercial 3 times in 10 min and started the episode from the start after every time. Update 1/10/22 still trash it wont load the right episode. Fold 3
5,This is literally the best way to listen to music as long as your willing to pay for premium and would actually use it enough for it to be useful. That being said Ive been using it for 7 years and been paying for premium off and on for about 5 and this is 2022.
1,Spotify can pay rogan 100 million dollars but they cant spend 10k on this shotty app? So many glitches and bugs and stop it cant switch what Im listening too it says its still playing a podcast that I listened to 3 podcasts ago
5,Here is a double trick for u guys!! To prevent ads!! You enjoy a song and when the song comes to an end where 5 or 10 secs left instantly select the next that is going to play so when a song is left incomplete ads dont pop out (some case it will not work but does 75%) [or] when ad starts playing click the song and come out of the app clear the recent tab and go in again this is also another trick....Thank me later....Try it
1,When I want to play a song but have to wait for 3 days of adverts and other songs I dont want to hear... Well thats why I dont use this app at all
3,Podcasts are better if they have captions/subtitles. Some of the songs do not have lyrics. The app would sometimes stop playing and unable to open.
1,Lots of bugs. And these bugs exist only on android version. iOS version is perfect and smooth
2,When it works its an ok app. But I have had several times where Ill get six or more ads in a row. Including a time at work when I had roughly four maybe five minutes of ads in a row. When Last Podcast on the Left is no longer a Spotify exclusive podcast Im probably going to delete the app.
1,Worked well for the past 5 years or so. Now it wont make it through a song without stopping. Online Ive tried all sorts of fixes but nothing. I guess its time to move on to another app. :(
3,simple convenient  affordable....... BUT WHEN LINKED FROM MY GALAXY S7 TO MY SAMSUNG HARMAN KARDON SOUND BAR THERE IS A CONSTANT REPETICIOUS BLANK OUT YOU CAN SET YOUR WATCH BY! $4000 Soundbar with sub and surrounds just begging for a facemelter ...only to receive a constant silent blip in every mode. DEVOED. No other app experiences this same issue with said soundbar. 3 stars coz they cant hear this music on Mars...
3,Some great features but we do need UHD higher sound quality lile Amazon Music has. I thought Spotify was supposed to have it implemented last year.
1,Simple. Everytime I select a song for ANYTHING it selects a different song. Not ok my Spotify on my PC does way better than this.
5,The recent updates have been amazing. The enhanced playlists actually give really good music and now a ton of songs have their lyrics attached! This app used to crash regularly but I havent experienced a crash in probably 2 months keep up the good work!
4,(Deleted review) The app is good I hope theyre working on letting users see songs inside albums and artists. Thats it. Aug 19 2020 No change seen. Well the app doesnt let u see songs in artist albums anymore and the ads are misleading as well.:male_shrug:
5,Best app for listening music. And I love that there are so many songs are there like songs of Instagram reels  songs of anime and kdrama. I am just addicted to this app So its very safe and useful app
5,This is the best app easy to use works across all platforms and syncs with other apps easily. Finds recommendations that are always on point new music or playlists that work well great algorithms!
5,Outstanding database of music. Like the lyrics feature. Looks of flexibility to create play lists.
1,i dont mind new features like discover but please bring the old design back like in ver 8.5.8 and make the quality of discover is adjustble because i use data and i dont have wifi... i can barely keep up with the subscription and stuff
2,Cancelled premium to try another platform as I find what Im looking for easier. Im not saying Spotify is a bad service but once you cancel your plan a screen with your paying method is shown up to you every time you open the app for you to pay for premium again interrupting you even if you have days left of premium and this becomes very annoying. If they want to keep costumers I find this a harassing way to do it to the point that Im afraid to pay for premium again in the future.
2,Lots of music yes. If you listen to one genre the same songs and or Playlists come up often lacks that diversity.
3,I hope there will be an upgrade in the equalizer. 5 band is good but I guess 10-band is better if there is no 31-band.
3,I having issues with the app on my phone and TV. The app on the phone sometime freezes and doesnt work well with my CarAndroid. The app on my TV stalls while playing videos almost every time.
1,Why does yalls app not know how to work with an sd card. It wont even open. It stays on the same dumb gray screen for idk how long. Fix yalls app i MIGHT download it again.
3,Pretty good selection of music and user friendly interface. But when I remove things from a queue and just let it play for any longer than an hour and not always that long it completely reshuffles the queue and its infuriating
3,One thing Im really upset about is the fact that you cant pick what song you want to listen to now. When I first got the app I could pick which one I wanted to listen to. But now I cant play any of them without having to shuffle the playlist which really really sucks. :/
3,Everytime i try and play another podcast or song the ui doesnt actually change so now im 120 min into a 40 min podcast. It lets me play other things but it doesnt actually switch to them
3,If I close Spotify I expect it to remove itself from my notification bar. It no longer does that making me accidentally cut music back on when Im removing my Bluetooth. Ive been having this issue for months. Please fix it.
1,Stops playing music all of the time. I might get 2 songs before I have to reopen the app and hit play again. Will be switching to a new music platform... lets see how long before this comment gets removed by spotify.
1,I think this is a good app but the only thing I dont like is when the song is over it plays a hole different song not even on the Playlist thats all.
1,EVERY time you try to use the app offline for more than a couple hours all of the songs in your queue get deleted and you cant add anything to the queue anymore. The only thing you CAN do is play shuffle and hope something good plays (you cant see what will play next either). What is the point of having premium and downloading songs in your phone if the app breaks everytime you go offline? When you are at a farm or roadtrip without internet spotify is useless. Better look for something else
1,Unusable on Samsung phone (works perfectly fine on any other devices I have). On my Samsung flip 3 the app doesnt even allow you to select a song and play it from your liked playlist or an artists page. For whatever reason it seems like you are required to have spotify premium in order to play the songs you actually want to play. Yet this has never been the case for me on anything else I use.
5,I love this app but I feel like its better on a laptop since you could skip the songs without worrying about running out of skips. I would love if this could change and both the mobile and laptop to skipping songs unlimited. Anyways I love this app and absolutely recommend. And thank you so much to the creators for making this app this is one of the best music apps I ever used. :relaxed:?:relaxed:?:relaxed:?
1,Painful. Spotify started to download 15gb of songs to my internal card when they were already on my sd card. Spotify forgot where to store them. Edit:. Just downloaded them all again today. When they are already on external card. Spotify now slow to open.
5,Spotify is the best music app ive tried its really easy to use and has a lot of recommended playlists that spotify makes and music that you can explore and the app is easy to use. even if a lot of people say there are a lot of ads and cant play the music they like because of the new update just pay for spotify its really cheap and youll find spotify easier to use when you pay for it. i use spotify everyday from day to night i thank everyone who built spotify and everyone who manages it
4,Its arguably the best music streaming app. The ads are annoying but I can tolerate them. The thing that I and many others hate though is that the shuffle feature isnt actually random and favors popular songs and plays them A LOT more often then less popular songs from the playlist. Please fix this spotify
1,the app has been oretty bugfy lately. Music starts playing in the background or suddenly stops the player displays a different song sometimes.
4,Great app but one thing dont like is that it doesnt let me list to eminem and I mad a Playlist just of his music to see if it was just my other Playlist but no I doesnt even show the music on there it doesnt show any music and I have already have updated it I just want to know if eminems music is not available on Spotify any more.
2,The app keeps stopping to display the song Im currently playing. I have tried all the fixes but nothing works. Considering moving to another service.....
5,Honestly didnt like it at first but in my opinionits subscription is affordable to most and I love the offline dowlading options. I also like how it builds playlists based on my taste in music and Spotify wrapped is cool. Im sure their are better options but Spotify is easy to use and has never shown itself to be a bad app.
2,For some reason this app REFUSES to close. I pause a podcast close the app and then it starts playing again after any notification. Help!
1,New update glitches and the music cuts out also when the phone locks the music stops playing and thats with premium version. Is this how Spotify is going to operate now? If so Ill cancel my subscription and find another app
4,The app is great but the automix of smooth transitions between songs is terrible especially when listening to amapiano songs on my own playlist. It could have been better if the current song is about to end it starts fading then the next song comes on smoothly. Wish it can do better.
1,I have got premium subscription but the playlist just suddenly stops playing... I have faced this issue in even downloaded playists... This happens with all bluetooth devices including earphones car... You cant stop your cycle and press play button after every song ends
5,Spotify is awesome as a service. I literally signed up because of Joe Rogan. Ive been thinking about it ever since Rogan and Spotify signed their deal but their adherence to their contract despite controversy sealed the deal. The user interface for the app isnt exactly intuitive. It is challenging to get back and forth into the queue versus a play list versus an album that Im looking at. I would maybe suggest multiple tabs that are easy to access.
1,Contentious ads. I dont have money to pay only for this music application. After listening to a song you say Now you will get 30 minutes uninterrupted services-this is the biggest scam ever in the world. Please take my words; Reduce the ads. :)
4,Only 4 stars because if you dont have premium you cant peak at the next song and that it sometimes just stops your song and you have to open the app to play it again. Other than that its great.
5,Ive found music that I havent heard since I was in high school really good for helping with music your not sure what the name is. Just a really Good place to Listen to your Tunes!:v::heartbeat:
5,Great app allows downloads. I have a really eclectic taste in music podcasts etc and theyre all covered like I say cracking app with almost no tech issues.
2,Absolutely terrible. Bluetooth capabilities for Spotify is the epitome of trash. Every 10 seconds the music will cut out for a moment or two making it impossible to even enjoy a song. Really this is infuriating considering my monthly bill for this. Jokes on me I guess. Thanks Spotify. @$$&oles
1,The more they tell me to get Spotify premium the more I feel like not getting it. Such cheap marketing gimmicks they are using. You know what I dont need your Spotify premium hell I dont even need your freaking Spotify even. Uninstalling. Have fun with your ridiculously cheap advertisements . Adios.
1,At first it just frustrates so much with ads for premium and then one day I took my premium free trial and it ended unexpectedly before even 24 hours. and i cant even choose songs to play anymore and even the playlists show distorted. I reached out to the spotify support and they told that every free account has this and they didnt even help. Its really unsatisfactory even the sudden changes and the support service.
3,It worked great for the last 2 months then all of a sudden I wasnt able to control the music from my lock screen anymore only the notification bar or the app itself and I cant seem to get it to go back to normal after 3 reinstalls and a Google search.
2,Ok software but the free version is almost unusable. If you try to play a song it will play any other song just to make you use all you skips up so you have to listen to their suggested music which are just tiktok songs. Cash grab
1,Inappropriate adds. It played when I diconect from a blue tooth device on my phone as well as for some reason always says its connected to something every 30 min youll get a notification saying spotify trying to open then it will say spoify connected to a unkown device super sus
1,Why is Spotify trying to open my audio files? I never gave it permission to open my audio files and it literally cant play them because they arent music. I cant find any setting on my phone or in Spotify that controls this so I cant change it and I now cant listen to my files as a result what is happening?!
1,Please fix the bug that stops the now playing screen working. You can start playing a song but the now playing screen doesnt change and you cant pause or seek through the song
1,I agree with many of the users here the app sucks so much. Why the hell cant I listen to the song I want to? I try playing murmaider but then it plays gas gas gas and when you try to select the song you want it just plays previews what the hell? This update basically just broke the app. I dont see how this is an improvement in anyway.
3,Spotify I would like for you to change the playlists every time but not with the same songs  different songs  I see the same songs in most of my playlists that you give me. Plus too many ads.
5,New to this. So easy to use. Loving building my library with a variety of media. Would like to see more female writers in the audio book menu. Family package is excellent. Im not all that fussed about the digital world but Im really engaging with Spotify I am enjoying having easy access to my favourite artists and listening to new stuff based in Spotifys recommendations.
1,One of the most problematic apps Ive ever used. It barely works and tends to be slow and buggy constantly. Theres no other app that I have with this many issues.
1,I love the app but lately when it changes itself to music similar to a playlist it changes to completely different type of music. Completely RUBISH!
1,Jesus I tried to play a song by Paul McCartney called new and it started playing some random song like seriously do I have to pay for premium just to play a certain song???! I recommend YouTube music 100%..... dont even bother replying because Im not getting this app you guys really need to fix this... its nonsense
4,4 stars because spotify needs you to buy premium to choose your own songs to listen to. If they make it so you dont need premium for that because I dont mind the adverts I wouldve rated it 5 stars. I usually use Songflip because of that but because people sometimes upload their own covers instead of the original song I end up stumbling back to Spotify. All Id say opinion wise let people choose their own songs in order without premium.
5,I can find 95% of the tunes I search for on Spotify. Their automated playlists hit the spot. Still waiting for the higher resolution streaming service though.
4,Love Spotify! I use it everyday. Weird glitch with my new phone. It stops playing when I turn my phone off and the que window gets stuck sometimes.
1,New update completely removed live bar on mobile. If you want to pause your music you have to unlock your phone open the app and pause it. Ill be cancelling my subscription before the start of February if it sticks cause Im not paying premium for no ads on an app with 0 out of app functionality thats pretty bare minimum stuff.
5,Love Spotify mobile and have for years. I swear the app runs better than my desktop application most days. Very user friendly with a large diversity of musicians. This app gets me through the day and is easily the most used thing on my phone.
5,I love being able to play what I want when I want ad free and being able to download songs so I can play them even out of service area. I dislike when other people are using Pandora etc and I have to listen to their stupid ads and have to listen to what is played not what you pick. So thankful for Spotify.
5,*Still stand by limits to free acct . But Prem. Us only 10$ Worth that and then sum! Awsome only thing is if dont pay cant skip tracks or choose whats playing can get frustrating to think of song search it then cant even play right the np
1,Sincerely I dont recommend this app its so bad without premium its so desperating cause the long ads you cant skip when you try to play a song you just cant YouTube and their ads are a million times better and with premium its not even good enough you dont have many songs in the app and you need to go to other app if you want to listen I sincerely recommend you to buy YouTube Premium its much better
2,I pay for premium yet my experience gets interrupted by ads from Spotify? Not happy about this I expect the problem to be rectified its no skin off my back to pirate the podcasts and music again.
1,PLEASE just let me listen to the songs I actually want to listen to! I dont need suggested or spotify added songs using up my skips when I make a playlist specifically for what I want!
4,One of the best apps to listen to music but there is a bad thing about it I dont know if its me or its the app because its give me like four ads right then it say enjoy 30 minutes with interruption and I play a song and after the song is done I get a ad:expressionless:
3,I dont like how on mobile it plays the wrong music when I click on the music I want to listen to and how I cant listen to my liked music but otherwise its a very good app to use!! :))
1,Edit: Changed my review to one star after the new update ruined Library function. Please add back the ability to search in a playlist by pulling down instead of having the find the submenu. Its there on iOs but androids dont get it anymore?? Stop making podcasts the focus of your app your users downloaded for music add a button to turn off podcasts and have a music only mode
2,Honestly I used to love Spotify and hype it up to everyone I knew. With this new update it always says no internet connection available no matter what. I cant load my Playlists I cant download songs I cant even open the app half the time!! Absolutely awful lately highly considering going to another music app asap.
3,I have YouTube music for now. Thinking about switching but I dont think Spotify has a play next button or Starr radio button.....these things a kind of a big deal to me...
1,I used to use spodify every day but now if I try to play a simple song it will shuffle it with a playlist that I didnt even make and it wont play the song I want it to I tried uninstalling and reinstalling to fix this but nothing...Ill go back to using spodify once this is fixed
1,ZERO SUPPORT. Going to support on their app sends you to promotions for premium service. If I cant get support no way Im paying for your (cr)app. Simple issue: turning off autoplay does not work I am forced into a random program when the one I sought out ends. Annoying AF esp bc it causes me to lose track on a history list. If I dont want fkn autoplay dont fkn force it on me. jfc
1,(10 January 2022) Theres a bug (maybe). When I choose payment for Spotify premium there are problems. First the subscription that I choose is different when I want to proceed to payment and second the payment that I choose in the first is different too when I go to next step
3,Love the app since its pretty easy to use just dont like how how the playlist changed to where now you cant choose the song instead its on shuffle all the time.
4,Still very good but the deletion of Car view is very disappointing. Used that all the time. I know you can link it to Google maps but I dont use Google maps. PLEASE BRING BACK CAR VIEW.
3,I loved the old version of this app but the new one is not as good and I dont use it as much anymore I get that they need to put adds in but I want to be able to choose the song I listen to instead of having to listen to a random song I dont like that the app has added to my playlist
3,There is absolutely no reason that when I make a Playlist that your algorithm should add songs that I didnt put in there its my Playlist for a reason if I wanted any other songs in it believe me I would put them there.
2,Premium user and have been for years. I used to LOVE this app and use it beyond daily! I am so upset that not glitches are more common and car mode is suddenly gone....unless I buy a separate gadget now...seriously considering finding a new app.
5,This is the most greatest app tp play music on! Ive been using Spotify for 2 years now and havent experienced any bugs/glitches! I highly recommend Spotify!
1,Often buggy and when you need customer support its hard to get to it. If you finally do the help takes way way too long and they still dont manage to get it all right (even though they say they did)
1,This app says its free and it is after 3 days it starts to play other music not on your Playlist. I like different types of music but now I have to endure spotifys selections of music. I do not like rap and modern music .I am older and like the music I grew up with. For 3 days I have waited for my music and nothing. I know this is done so you pay for it but they should have told me that all the time I spent downloading songs to my Playlist was for nothing unless I pay.
4,I little difficult to set up the perfect playlist for every situation but I love music so much and being able to look up a trendy song or lyric and listen to related songs over and over again it works while I work! :us::eagle::earth_americas::anchor::call_me_hand|type_3::pray|type_1_2::heart:
5,I would highly recommend this app to anyone who loves music. Everything is simple and easy to use while recommending new music to you that really does match your preferences.
5,I love bc when you premium you can do a lot of things and the musics unlimited theres not all the music that you want but theres most of it and if you cant find a song youre looking for you type up the lyrics and other people have made albums with the music in the album
3,Awesome app ! The music is of great quality and has wide variety. There are also a variety of podcasts to listen to and a few personal specks that make for a great listening experience. If you dont have a premium account it can be a bit frustrating to use but still wonderful - I definitely recommend !
5,With YouTubes rapid uncontrollable descent into hedgemonic behaviour its belligerent attitude towards users its Premium subscription and bundled music app (YT Music) are no longer worthy of my time or money. Luckily SPOTIFY turns out to be a perfect and much better alternative app to music streaming and with better streaming quality. My upgrade to 5 stars was not trivial and I hope that Spotify continues to improve and most importantly continues to take their users opinions seriously.
5,Spotify has everything I like to listen to and more. Create your own playlists mix and match music to satisfy your mood. My #1 go to when I hit the highways and just wanna hear it all.
1,Unfortunately I have tried to put this programme on my phone and although I already have an account it doesnt accept the password and I just went around in circles. Therefore after the third attempt I just gave up and uninstalled it. Im afraid I wont be able to use it. Maybe there is another music app out there. Sorry.
5,Love it!!! Finally found an app that I can create a playlist without ads & its free! Up to date on music trends can listen to others playlist. Found some oldies but goodies too! Lol Thank you Spotify!!!
1,I download and reinstall this app 3 times and podcast STILL wont play. I have full bars 5G still nothing. I download amazon music with the same connection and get a podcast playing within seconds.
3,Before I would have give n this app a five star easily. But now you cant go on a pecific album and see songs you just kind of have to go with the shuffle. Its not the biggest deal in the world but it does inconvenience me. Ads were fine and it has every song you could want to hear for all genres. I do hope this is fixed soon.
2,Very buggy and not very intuitive. Skipping tracks can cause the music to stop playing and it can be a right pain getting it started again.
1,When I click on a song it doesnt play the full song it just plays 5 seconds of the same part of the song everytime I click on the song. I don�t know if its my fault or yours but Im still giving it 1 star because it shouldnt even be a feature.
1,i guess it has good music but i got 8 adds in a row once and it wasnt even for a 30 minute add free thingy which btw does not give you 30 minutes its more like 25 minutes but only if u dont switch playlists or skip.
2,I dont know what changed but now if Im listening on my tablet and I get a call on my phone or I open something with audio like a reels on IG... my Spotify music stops playing on my tablet and starts playing on my phone. This is REALLY INCONVENIENT as I use it for my work and I cant keep running put of the room to restart the music every time I get a phone call. And yes... I ended and or turn off group sessions but it still happens
1,What went wrong Spotify? Why did it suddenly became like this? Why did it add songs and i cant delet them they keep getting added by Spotify. Please fix that thank you.
5,Just glad that the lyrics feature is back on the roll after a very long time. Moreover the little ui tweaks day by day is also great and enhances the experience than what it was before. Happy to be a premium member and keep up with the minimal great changes :)
4,Why cant you skip back without premium? Spotify keeps skipping songs on its own not only wasting my 6 skips but also going past something Id like to listen to but I cant go back without paying for it. Give going back its own 6 an hour for all I care Id like to go back songs.
5,Always great. I have been a Spotify Premium user for 5 years +. Its been great. Friendly user interface always the greatest newest music in high quality. I love the new Blend mode with friends and the yearly reviews. It would be really need to see a chat involved with the Friend Blends to comment and communate about tracks on them between each other.
5,I really love Spotify it one of my top used apps. And I love to listen to a studying play list will Im studying it helps a lot and Spotify is just an over all really great app and I highly recommend for u to download it if u havent already. :joy::joy:I love doing this :joy: :joy: it lets me sound like an overly paid critic :joy::joy::joy:
5,I really enjoy Spotify... and all the access to so much great music... even the occasional commercials are usually amusing... Spotify is an excellent option....
5,Its usually a great app but very buggy lately. Keeps freezing and stopping then refusing to play again unless I restart everything. Not a signal issue as it does it when Im connected to my home WiFi. Pretty frustrating.
5,All round great app. Well worth paying the subscription for. Discover weekly is my favorite feature Ive discovered so many artists I now love. Also appreciate the ability to download songs for offline use no other app has stood the test of time like Spotify has for me.
1,I choose a song them spotifi play it for 5 seconds and then switches to their chosen song. Not allowed to skip at my preference. I absolutely hate this app.
2,The app is great. Excellent music selection... but the worst app connection to car radio. My factory radio keeps on misbehave when app connects to it. No more handsfree or usb. Cant even use normal radio. Then have to reset bluetooth connections to radio. Then remove app from phone and then everything works perfect. Reinstall spotify. And radio goes bonkers again..
5,Im not very good with this kind of stuff but Im persevering and its getting easier for me to listen to all my favourites and find new music anyone with a little more brainpower will love it
3,Very nice and trendy soundtracks and playlists in this specialised app.Keep up with the current systemhoweverdo add in more skips for the normal spotify account and make the premium account public for all to use and enjoy. However dont install this because when u play a playlist it will get stuck on it and u cannot fix it.
1,Its a shame that you cant give 0 stars on an app. Spotify used to be the best music app but now its horrible like seriously 6 SKIPS PER HOUR! Also on top of that when you make a playlist it adds a bunch of songs and you cant stop it so you have to deal with songs you dont like. And the adds are so long it used to be 30 seconds for 30mins which I can deal with bet 1min of ads for 2 songs! ITS DESPICABLE!!!
3,_Offline_ features barely work when my internet connection is unstable. This is absolutely annoying. A music player app should really not get in ones way of simply listening to downloaded songs...
5,I wish the app had a ranking and review button none of the apps has this feature. This will make easy to listening to podcast some music such as hypnosis etc. Keep this feature free if implemented.
3,Great app does what it is meant to. Took a star off because they need to make a way to pick up where you left off on multiple podcasts as I often start one then forget what podcast I was listening to then start another.
3,Awful for Podcasts. Re-plays already played episodes and the organization is weak. I wouldnt even use Spotify but I listen to a lot of Parcast pods and they went Spotify exclusive. Poor choice on their end.
4,The shuffle feature doesnt shuffle very well and tends to play the same songs every time I shuffle a playlist. Other than that its a great app! I love the recommendations!
3,I took premium just to listen podcasts on spotify but there is video podaat but dont have audio podcast feature online and it sucks my limited internet data very fast. Please add feature so we can listen audio podcasts as well Please
1,No. I loved Spotify. But now u made it so I cant listen to songs individually. And u added songs to my playlist. I need to listen to red (taylors version) in the CORRECT order. Im not going from all too well to nothing new. Thats songs away. And the fact that it goes to different artists. Just no. Im not having it show up on my wrapped this year:sob: I just wanna listen to rwylm and ittg bc its a year old now.
3,I like this app I can play any music on it but now whenever I try to press on one song it just plays another one and its so annoying because it takes like 3 minutes to get the song I want to play.
5,Free version not worth it. But premium is way worth it. If you dont plan on paying for premium dont get it. But if you do plan on getting premium their is no better music service
5,This app is too good when i travels i can listen too good songs and all kinds of mysic is available here and all play lists are there and when i am sriting i use to get too much of headache but when i starts writeing by listening musics it makes me fell good and i use to complet my work very fast thank for providing such app tq so much
4,Hate it when i go play a song and its non playable on one of my play list but not on another.. scratching my head and doing some swearing. Otherwise its good. Prices go up and I dont get no notification that it is until you take it out of my account..
1,Whenever I try and play a song it just plays a totally different one out of nowhere and when i try to play my playlist it also plays different music. Please fix this.
4,Until recently Spotify was my favorite application but for 2 months now I have a problem that is when I open the app it takes too long and then it comes out that it does not respond I have to exit and then re-enter and sometimes I It takes so long that I prefer to use another music app or listen to my songs already downloaded. It is a problem that overwhelms me a lot because I love to use my playlists in this app.
4,Spotify is amazing it is my top used app on my phone. I always have songs playing. I wish there werent as many as bc I would like to be able to cry without hearing about the new samsung watch. Thank you.
1,USELESS. It used to be good but now you cant even pick your own songs and you have to shuffle but you cant shuffle for more than 6 times so might as well use YouTube instead.
5,Spotify is pretty great. I now have premium but before hand the ads werent that bad. I definitely use this app on the daily for sure. Great music and suggestions to discover music too.
2,Okay. New update. It sucks tbh. I cant see my songs on a playlist. I listened to Spotify for so long. Ive deleted and reinstalled the app. Ive logged out and back in. After a year of using this app I am not mad but kinda sad. Its pretty much unusable if you have a free account. Some people cant afford stuff and your taking that away from them. This is sad. 6 skips per hour with a free account. I would give this a 5 star before the newest update.
4,I just like this app..But always stay adsmany times can very long but many songs many artist and I think all songs could be here.I love this appbut lyrics are here and I love it so go on ..good job I love you all
4,They have all the music and tunes I find missing on other apps. I know I havent explored the app fully but for now Im happy just setting Allister and listening.
4,This app is main stream and has all of my favorite songs artists and podcasts. I love using this app day and night and absolutely am in love with the premium version!! I loved the end of the year wrap on Spotify where it tells you your number one listened to song and number one artist etc. Only 4 stars though because premium used to only be a dollar and now its ten dollars a month. Please lower the premium price and this app will get 5 stars for sure!!
1,Gave it a trial to see if spending money on this would be wise. Answer: Hell no! UI is comolez there is no easy navigation. Sound quality is no way any better. Hiby player is million times better than Spotify. Song collection is still not that good honestly. And the amount of monthly fee is just too much to ignore all the lackings that Ill be paying for
4,Great sound quality easy to make playlists wear os app is also nice but it requires being connected to phones spotify. Though premium is pretty much required and some smaller artists I can find on soundcloud/youtube/bandcamp arent available on spotify but most of what I listen is available. Trying with a trial of premium atm considering starting to pay for it mainly because the sound quality is way better than other apps I use. Btw you need to set quality in settings for best quality.
3,I love the variety of artists and music and everything but Ive found that they repeat songs even though the songs on that playlist have not been exhausted. For one artist tonight within two hours they played the same song 4 times. I could think of at least 2 songs from that artist that were not played at all.
1,Continually downloads already downloaded music.. I spend more time out of service range than I do in service so downloadable music is what I pay for.. no good if I cant listen offline. Then after being offline app asks for re login but wont allow because its set to offline.. deleted app in hope to reset... Now can not download app to phone again after 2 days trying.. Was similar on iOS but the Android version is way worse. Now Im paying a premium for something I cant even add to my phone
5,Its the best overall music streaming app Ive tried many of the competitors but I always come back for Spotify hands down best experience.
1,This app is terrible I cant listen to any album without it adding a random song in between it. There are far too many ads. A money hungry app if you ask me.
1,Its good at the part of songs but after a while it will just delete your Playlist and change it with recommended songs. It becomes more annoing because it wont let you change it ever again with any songs so it wont let you pic a song from any Playlist ever again after a month so it becomes useless to ever use again. And it will automatically more liked songs if you dont have enough then it shuffles like 20 different songs even though you say 1 song
2,When I first got this loved it I have it on my computer as well but I have some problems 1. on my phone when Im listening to song and Im in other apps it cuts off 2. I cant loop and it shuffles on its own so I dont know what song is going to play next. From my computer I give it a 4/5 but on my phone 2/5
4,It wont work while Im somewhere offline but other than that its fine. The songs are high quality and I like how you can listen to it while working.
5,Love this app makes my life so much easier as a high-school student. Being able to listen to anything whenever and wherever I want. Plus with the new lyrics to almost every song I get to sing (out of tune) in the shower. Highly recommended for everyone!
1,The app was great when I first got it. I could choose the song I wanted loop the song I wanted AND listen to a song in my playlist in any order. I dont know if this is the update but please get rid of it. I now can only listen to my playlist in shuffle and it doesnt show my songs.
2,This app has BUGS! This app dose work well but every time I use it it has some form of glitch and it is usually related to the ads it needs to be fixed. Without this bug I would give this app a 5 star rating.
2,Latest update decreases functionality by removing Car View to upsell to a separate Car Thing accessory. I have truly enjoyed your service but removing this option is a step backward for me. Will consider switching services. Addendum: still hoping to see a revision that returns the car view to the app. Makes the ease of use far less user-friendly without.
1,Everytime i connect my blutooth headphones and turn on Spotify it automatically disconnectes it . Ive tried other apps then my headphones work but whenever i turn this app on they dont work and glitch what kind of an app is this
1,This app is so overrated. Whenever someone sends me their Spotify link to listen music all I get is some random bullcrap. Why cant I just listen to music that I pick and not getting 30 minute ad or to buy premium.
5,Great app. My music taste improved a lot from it thanks to the Playlists I found (made by other users) I was able to find new and underrated songs I really liked. I use to not like to listen to music much because everything I found sounded very generic to me but thanks to this app I was able to lengthen my knowledge on different songs and genres and overall live a better emo life.
2,Pity. Its an amazing app if you have a premium account. I enjoyed it a lot. But If you dont you cant even play a song you want which is the worst. I mean I would even accept some advertisement before a song but not being able to play it at all is too much. So it really is pay to listen.
2,The constant bugs are annoying for a service I pay for. My songs will skip in their own all the time and its very frustrating.
5,i love using spotify but currently on my samsung galaxy s9 i havent been able to pause my music from the lock screen or play it if it was previously paused. im not sure what to do about that is there something you can do to fix it? ive tried reinstalling the app restarting my phone fore stopping the app etc. and nothing is working.
2,The music quality the lyrics and podcasts are the best. I think the paid version is worthed. But Im not sure why every time you open the app always says there is not connection and you have to wait like 1 minute. The others apps I have in my phone works perfect with cellular data.
1,I just hate this app. There are WAY too many ads like it comes every 2 songs or so. And you cant choose/play a specific song. Random songs that are out of the playlist start playing. Also I cant play a playlist that has less that 10 songs without random songs playing like its sooo annoying. If you really want to listen to music more comfortably and freely I do not recommend Spotify. You could use other apps.
1,Im a fan of spotify but the new update disappointed me. I cant even play the music I want I need to wait a hour to shuffle it to listen to the musoc I want to hear. The new update sucks. Its harder to used. The last version is better. And the limited skips drives me crazy. I cant even skip the intro of the song because I cant control it. I hate the update. The ads are not tolerable.
5,I have premium and the price of it isnt bad its the same as Discord nitro and less than Amazon prime. Their recent feature of lyrics has saved me so much time when I dont know the lyrics of a song I Google it and now I dont have too. 10/10
3,The current UI needs work. Theres certain elements that work better even in the Lite version such as album sorting. Create an option to stop being forced upon random podcasts - maybe a seperate tab. Thanks for adding lyrics +1*. Downloaded playlists and albums get deleted often. Maybe add some optional listening stats. Its a good app there has been some improvements over the past few months but these frustrations are off-putting.
5,The service in general is very good. The app itself is too bare. An option to create a personalised library of favourite albums that looks like the one in Poweramp would be great. The integration with Sonos and Chromecast is very bugged lots of disconnections or hang ups that force me to force quit and restart the app. Recently Im starting to dislike the black and green theme too. I would rather have the option to change it to a classic black text on a white background.
3,So I used to be able to tap my Playlist and then pick a song or just pick the first song on the top of my Playlist to restart it now I have to press the shuffle button and it annoying and you can only skip 6 time per hour. Spotify please fix this it used to a 5 star but with this new thing its a 3. Now I have to listen to pandora.
5,All is good now. A couple of months of car Bluetooth issues with it but sorted with recent updates. Love family premium lots of listening here!
2,Used to be great. Has slowly decayed into trash. Now censoring swear words on top of bugs random starts and stops extreme number of ads etc..The list goes on. Avoid paid subscription with this one. Scammy.
5,I love Spotify when you added lyrics it became clear that this app was amazing. I only have two issue. That maybe in the next update you make a karaoke. And that you can listen to music offline
4,it can be pretty anoying without premium but it is still a good app and when you get premium it is a amazing app for music. i have normally been able to find everysong im looking for. i just wish there werent so many adds but even with them i highly recomend this app. the playlist customization is also very fun there are also already made playlist which is amazing.
5,Even though this app is cool one thing is when I first got my phone I instantly got Spotify and signed into my account but when I found out I had no adds (literally not one single add) I found out I was on family zone on Spotify so I was exited and happy. Of you are new to Spotify then enjoy your new experience :upside_down:
2,The latest updates ( I have premium) seemed to have runied the experience. Cuts out  shows wrong tracks fills up my phone both on device and SDcard memory. Have had to uninstall it from my phone. Will wait a few days then reinstall it again. Will unsubscribe with heavy heart if it has not mega improved!
5,Good music app :+1: You can listen offline or online and make playlists with songs you like . You can also find playlists and podcasts I recommend getting this app :)
5,Its great but only issue is there r some 18+ podcast which r easily visible while searching for songs by their name so hopefully u can fix it by giving a 18+ optionwhich means such podcast will be shown if u enable it or something. Its upto yall I m just suggesting
2,I made a just want to listen to certain songs but it makes me listen to others before that. I made a Playlist and it added songs Ive never heard into it. Kind of annoying.
4,I gave it a 4 because.. I dont understand why we have to pay for 1 month of FREE premium- Other than that- its awesome but it would be better with out it telling me I cat skip science I used it up. But like I said- I dont understand why we have to pay for a 1 month of FREE premium. Unless its me just being stupid ?:expressionless:
2,I love this app but when i play the song that i want it keep playing random song that i dont know and it makes me angry pls fix this we want to listen the songs that we want and have fun listening to it. Its like when you want to listen on something but spotify do their own decisions to play random songs that you didnt heard before.
1,Ive been forced onto this. I pay for it as family want it. I hate the shuffle. Albums and playlists are all shuffled. The UI is too simple you cant seem to configure it to play in another way. Also I play an artist and it adds in others please no. Bring back the superior Google Play.
1,Why cant we manage our homepage and decide which one that we want to keep and which is not?? I accidentally listened to this one random podcast for few minutes and I cant remove it from the your shows list AT ALL. This is a VERY VERY BAD UI DESIGN. Either fix this or fire your employees who designed this clunky interface. Theres no way for me to change this even though I tried with premium subscription and this is clearly a violation to customer right.
5,cheap premium great quality every song i think of is on here and im into a lot of pretty niche music works well even on poor internet which is great. i could listen to music seamlessly even on the second basement level in the car park.
3,Was great to use at one time. They keep updating things and changing things that are not broken. One example is car mode which is still not replaced with the better feature they said they were working on months ago. So far the only fix is buy a separate module for your car which is only available the U.S. Very poor app experience lately.
1,Broken on Android auto Too many Ads on phone. Its says uninterrupted playing for 30 minutes but ads will plays after 2-3 songs. It plays Chinese songs between English or Hindi. wft? In addition I cannot play songs from watch speaker even if songs are downloaded on watch
3,I give a 3 star writing simply because I do not want to start over this app used to be great I used to love it but as of lately it has been very glitchy and adds songs and playlists on its own. I pay for premium and it does not give me the premium service in which i pay. Until i find a better app ill stick it out for now
2,What happen in my Spotify its hard to play my spotify is full of advertisement and whenever i play music it only play the chorus thats frustrating i want to sing but i cant see the lyrics of the song please fix it
4,I love Spotify but the only one problem that is stopping form getting 6 stars is how many skips you get I understand the reson for this & I agree with the point too but at least try to add more skips or make it free!
2,I listen to music daily on this app. I understand you put ads money are good thats not the problem it doesnt bother me. The problem is playing suggested songs randomly and not my playlist. Its super annoying I turned the autoplay setting off and it still does it. Extremely disappointed
5,So I switched from IPhone to Google Pixel a while back never did get on with Apple. So Spotify it was. I wear hearing aids and recently upgraded to ones that I can stream to and are also the best buds I ever owned ! I was stuck in the 80s as I guess thats when I last heard music properly and dismissed new acts. With these new buds and Spotify both learning what I like and finding what I like it has been life changing. From 1 song I now have a 26 HR playlist New Tunes 21 Im 59 get me
2,Latest update doesnt auto restart audio after a YouTube link is clicked. Running app in background is turned on in option but when close all app is selected on the phone Spotify gets closed down Please update the ugly bar widget to a 2x2 tile or other options to fit Android 12s design
4,This app is amazing ? always listen to music from here. However the adverts are irritating ?t is about alcohol and other things that are totally not suitable for me. It also says says 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening but literally ten minutes later I see two adverts.
5,Using this app with a tablet or pc is decent a few songs then ads but atleast you can choose the song you like to play unlike using a phone it wont give you the song you wanted plus limited skips.
3,The ads come too frequently and very repetitive. The ads keep interrupting like after every song there will be an ad longer than a song. Other than this its a nice app.
5,This is a really good app for music especially when you have troubles with other music apps. Its really simple and easy to use. It also recommends you music to listen to if you find it interesting.
5,I have found Spotify to be the best of all music channels on my phone. It brings back so many. Happy memories. Takes me back to the early 50s and the later 70 80. Which many would argue it was the best era in Australian music and times.
5,Spotify is a really good app that doesnt have a lot of ads and even when it does they are only short so I realy enjoy this app and if you choose artists to like they will appear on your home screen
2,Its just sucks. Its got great collection but cant even play them without having a glitch. Once my entire library was wiped clean. It keeps loging out and buggy connectivity issue so fix it!
5,Music mixes reflecting my varied preferences were well made. I was able to listen to the new and the old favorites within the same sequence without having to look for the music I wanted to hear. Wide range of selection of original artists and songs! Excellent.
5,Ive had Spotify for many years they have saved my playlists all these years. I have had periods when I couldnt afford to pay a membership but they still kept it together. To sit and listen to the 100s of songs through the years is an awesome way to relive those past loves and good times some dark times as well. You can not find a better one than Spotify or one thats been around longer.
1,This is an awful app for listening to podcasts. Spotify devours battery life while watching video podcasts. Fix this already! Update: app continues to be awful for podcast listening.
2,I like how the songs are free but when i go to my playlist and i pick a song it just plays a short clip of the song and the not whole song also im in mobile. Please fix it therefore i can give it a 5 stars.
1,Terrible app Ive had Spotify since 2010 in Spain it wasnt available in Canada when I moved so I waited until 2017 to use it again. Ive had Spotify Premium all this time and Im so close to unsubscribing. The PC app works great but the phone one always has issues. Eternally loading a playlist pauses at random search queries just load and show no results... awful! It needs a good round of QA its so annoying dealing with such a buggy app.
5,What l absolutely like about Spotify is l can listen to a fantastic array of music with out trying to find my cd collection and then I find out some of them wont play l its convenient and it sounds awesome through my sound systeml would like to thank you whoever you are that created this site Im wrapped :smiley:
5,Spotify has been a really helpful platform where I can stream music for absolutely free!! The quality is top notch and every song in the world can be found on this app. You can even listen to your friends playlists and have a great time listening to your favourite music. Premium definitely unlocks a new world. 100% recommended app.
3,I love to hear music in Spotify but sometimes it freezes and logs me out and does not let me get in and it takes long to open the app. But the rest is great.
5,I had a cheap LG K40 for about a year and a half. This app had no issues performing on it. I upgraded my phone recently so... this app still works (duh) and I dont know what more to say..
5,Love the App very good selection of songs. Especially when you search for someone you find when you though how have I never heard this awesome song before or musician..
5,Little bugs easy to navigate interface heavy selection of artists Playlists are nice this has become the golden standard of what a music platform has to offer.
3,The app is great but whenever I try to listen to music on another app the music stops. Another thing is that its continuously saying its not responding.
4,A must have for anyone who enjoys music an podcasts but are not able to find everything in just one streaming service... another algorithm different suggestions... Ive found I was running out of space on my phone and Spotify was filling almost 5 GB of files ?! I didnt downloaded any song only listened to via streaming. So I uninstalled de app and tried the lite version it works OK but has no lyrics option there and for some songs is a desirable feature... So giving another try...
5,An amazing app with songs from all genres and times. Found my grandfathers bands cover of Miserlou on here. His band was the one who wrote Miserlou and I have only found it on this app. Bands name was The Emotionals. Great work my friends.
4,Very giid app almost no problems. The only Thing is that it says that i dont have any internet while all my other apps work just fine. But apart from this it is a app that works perfect.
4,I really love this app. I love how I can listen to all of the different genres of music even the obscure music. I would have given you 5 stars except for one thing. I hate how you start the next song when theres ten seconds left of the song Im listening to and Im hearing both songs at the same time. If you would fix this little problem I would give you that fifth star.
5,Spotify has had all of the music that I have ever wanted to look up no matter the genre and plays with no problem. I live this app!!
5,This is an amazing app this has no at all ads and its just an amazing app that nobody can compare to and it is amazing how when you turn off your phone you can still listen to your music
4,I have Spotify Plus because Im in highschool so I cant have Student and Im broke so I cant use Premium and pay $10 every month so Plus is great. What I dont like about Plus is the fact that I cant skip ads on my Google TV sometimes and the fact that my Google Home still treats it like the free tier. So that sucks. But literally everything else is fire. I love it.
4,It pauses itself in between songs until I turn my screen on or press the button been happening for over a week now and never happened before. BUG.
2,Terrible user experience since the last update select a playlist and it plays a completely different one under the selected playlist name. Buggin out badly. Paid for premium family for years now sort it out or I will cancel.
1,i used to love this app a few months ago but now its really frustrating to use i cant even choose the song i want to listen to before an ad suddenly pops up. least to say im pretty dissapointed in this app just update to a version that can be easier to use.
5,Dont have to worry about loosing the music I love again. Really easy to use and has a great algorithm that points me to other musicians. I really hope that these bands get something for their time they are true lifesavers. Thank you Bands/spotify
2,Its good but rather than commercial ads you ppl just annoy me with your own premium ads ... actual ads are kind of okay but you are shouting out too much for premium membership. Even if i become multimillionaire  I wont buy premium membership. Just because  you ppl annoyed me enough. I am using my own data which is good enough for me to stream everyday music online whats wrong in that  anyway I have recharge for costly unlimited packs.why should I buy premium ?
1,I have my settings set to not play any additional songs after a Playlist has completed yet every time Ive played any Playlist in the past two weeks there are additional songs that get played. I have my kids around and I dont want them hearing some random song that popped on. Update: still happening.
1,Why do you change my lock screen saver? Stupid ! Dont ever install this app.. If you listen for songs then they they will have your screen saver lock and no one knows how to remove it. Apart from this app is fantastic. Iam going to uninstall after commenting as I donno how to remove the spotify screen saver.
5,It would be incredible if you guys could figure out a better layout for the now playing song part for tablets. (You know the one with the lyrics and play/pause buttons.) Something like putting the lyrics on one side of the screen and the play/pause buttons on the other side. Left and right. Guys it would be nice if we had the ability to check the date of release of songs.
2,I just want to search and play a damn song. No I dont want my selected song to be shuffled randomly in some God awful playlist. Just sort your awkward UI and maybe this app wi be worth using.
4,I mean i like this app its got all the music i need and want but there are just tooo many adds there are sometimes like 2 adds together i dont even listen to 4 songs and there are 7 adds it is gravely frustrating plz fix this.... but other than that this app is great....
4,It is a good app where I can listen for my favorite songs. There are many playlist and albums that I can listen to. I give it a 4 stars because the ads sometimes gets too annoying
2,Honestly it was great for a long while. But once the monthly thing ended it was torture especially the 6 skips per hour. In conclusion Ill say it was good...until time ran out
3,Nice music app but when i listen to a playlist sometimes i get songs that i did not put in and if i try to skip i wont go back to the added songs. I have to wait until a ad before i can listen to the added music. and i cant like songs no more
3,Very good selection but not the easiest thing to navigate. Setting up wasnt easy either. However once sorted a pleasure.
4,really good app. I love using Spotify because it has most of my favorite tracks the only issues I see are the fact that most Nintendo tracks arent on Spotify and that I cant organize my playlist. 9/10
2,I like spotify but podcasts arent avilable where i live and also i want the mobile version to be like the desktop version(so we can skip tracks and play the tracks that we want not just shuffle).
3,Its good but could be better Im talking about the layout how easy it is to move your finger to the buttons you always use I dont understand why they always want all option buttons to be up high on a phone when 90% of us have smartphones and have to move our finger all the way to the top of the screen just to add the song to our playlists. Like especially when you listen to so much music and AHH so annoying. Stupid Devs and their stupid designs. Also have more to add but theres no space.
5,Awesome music nonstop. Love this app. The ads is short and is not disturbing at all. i recommend this app if you want to listen to some music while relaxing .
5,Ever since I started using it Ive never downloaded music. I just listen to playlists according to the mood in feeling. Great app!
5,I am always fascinated how people are not grateful and always bitching and moaning about stuff. You literally have an ability to listen to music from all places times so easily and comfortably for a monthly price of a cup of coffee. There will always be minor bugs imperfections and stuff. Thank you spotifyyou are a wonder
1,Spotify used to be known for recommending good music but lately all it does is recommend the same thirty songs over and over. The console version is riddled with bugs. Come on guys
4,The app is great and I love how I can listen to my favorite artists recent music. But it sucks not being able to listen offline without premium.
1,Shocking. What happened to Spotify? Okay so I can deal with a 30 second ad to have 30 minutes uninterrupted music but what the hell is with the only 6 skips thing? That is absolutely ridiculous. Spotify 10 years ago used to be the go to place for streaming a genuine company that didnt try to rake all the cash they could off people. Now its just pay for this pay for that Been around since spring 2009 but I dont feel welcome without paying. Such a shame wont be using ever again sadly.
1,Way too many adds. Its literally bloated with obnoxious commercials. At times your music selection goes completely off and shows a random music unrelated to your already set preferences.
1,Spotify premium is great! Free is... Unplayable. You cant listen to more than a few seconds of a song and it installs advertisements for McDonalds into your phones task bar! They start you off with free premium for a month (without asking/informing you) so suddenly features dont work anymore that you thought you had...
5,SPOTIFY is the BEST musical streaming service available. BOTTOM LINE! Spotify rarely crashes and works continuesly VERY WELL! Ive veen enjoying SPOTIFY for over a EIGHT YEARS and will continue for the REST OF MY LIFE!
1,App promised 30 minutes ad free paused it for a few minutes to deal with something checked the time when the ad happened and when I came back 18 minutes had passed. Skipped the song I was on heard one more song (3 minutes) and got three consecutive ads.
2,Decent app but its kinda hard to find what you want. How come there is no spoken language filter for podcasts? Spotify is putting too much trust into their recommendation algorithm but sometimes its completely off. Not everyone wants to listen to pocasts/songs in their own language. This is where the search function is supposed to come in but its weak and lacking good filters. Finding the original singer when a song has many versions is hard too especially for some anime songs.
3,I used to loveee Spotify because all the songs that I loved was free! But then when I came back from school to hear some music the music was halfway done and made me hear something else and also said this music is for premium or something
2,I use to love Spotify. I enjoy listening to podcasts but lately the app had been acting up. I will stop out of nowhere. Or it will say that it is playing when it isnt :thinking: Im thinking of Unsubscribing but I have hope this will be fix :frowning_face:?:disappointed:
2,would love if i could use the app without uninstalling and reinstalling everytime the player goes away in my notifications. seems the recent update went too far into trying to make something more of what already worked. please fix this asap i pay for premium for a reason.
5,Great listening platform and with premium (which even gives active students a discount!) Allows me to do anything I could possibly ever want to do with my music and even has tons of music in different languages which lets me listen to some great French music while im learning the language!. Merci beaucoup Spotify!
1,Shuffles even when auto shuffle is off. Raised it up but nothing has been done. Update 1 year in and Spotify cant resolve the problem. Useless.
2,Easy way to listen to music but I dont want to pay for songs. Also it turns on randomly and it doesnt turn off. Thats my complaint. Im going back to my music app. Sorry if I sounded rude. But please let me know when you have an update.
3,Its a good app but I dont have premium and it makes it so hard to listen to songs ubwant I make a playlist and all it does is play suggested songs that have nothing to do with what Im listening to and when I try to play my liked songs it plays ones Ive removed as if their still there
5,Overall its a good app for playing music that you want to hear. If you can afford it you should definately purchase premium. However you can still get away with the free version but you will only be able to shuffle on mobile. To get the most of it you also need to use it on other devices such as Google nest Chromecast and PC. I wish I had lyrics on mobile but currently I dont.
1,Ads are fine if anything theyre a necessity. But not playing the songs in your play list and forcing you to listen to bands you dont like aint cool. Also the app lags between multiple devices. Edit: Not being able to cancel your subscription in the app is ridiculous and honestly I thought companies were past that kind of predatory behaviour at this point locking in consumers and putting up obstacles to stop them from unsubscring is no longer the norm and spotify needs to catch up.
5,Almost every song you want to hear is on this app. The ads can get a bit annoying but otherwise an incredible music and podcast streaming app
3,Like the app but i would like to have the colorful play navigation bar under my notifications like my note 8 does. Not sure why they havent implemented that feature for newer phones
1,SpotifY SUCKS and their paid service Premium is a total scam. DO NOT GIVE THEM ANY MONEY. My spouse has a premium accountwe are supposed to be able to have Premium Duo. But while I can login with google to my account I cannot log in it to access Duo with the exact same credentials. Total waste of money.
5,The days of MP3s and Wav files seem like theyre finally gone. Its kind of sad but with features like listening with your friends on Discord and Spotifys algorithm to recommend artists Ive listened to three times the amount of music that I used to. I will stay premium likely for years to come.
5,Great app  you can still hear the songs you are playing while viewing other apps even you are not yet a subscriber. But I decided to subscribe for me to explore and listen other beautiful songs that are not available to non subscribers. :relaxed:?:hugging:
5,Ive been using Spotify since my 6th Grade year. Ive loved this app from the beginning. Apple music was so teasious because you had to buy each song individually and then Spotify came along and created playlists where users can be creative and make music truly their own without having to pay for each song. I am very thankful for Spotify. I myself have my own Podcast on Spotify called New Life Motivation that I created because I discovered a Podcast called BenLionelScott and saw the good.
3,It was fine for the first year I had it but now whenever I try to listen to music on it it stops every song around the 11 second mark. I have the songs downloaded and everything it shouldnt be my internet connection.
3,I love the app shows great library of music. But I dont appreciate everytime they add a song I never added to my playlist. Please dont add songs that I dont add.
5,This app is great. On the pc app you can skip songs unlimitedly. You can listen to as much music as you want each month/week for free with minimal ads.
1,The autoplay setting is completely broken--it will always keep playing different music regardless of what your app setting choice is. Very annoying!
3,Its a good app. Although I logged out of my account so my friend could do something on her account cuz her phone died. But when I tried to log back in it said my account doesnt exist. Im still logged into it on my Playstation and Im putting in the exact info like username and everything on my phone but it still says it doesnt exist.
5,Love having this app on my phone. This is the best music app I have ever tried. I love how they make you your own music playlist based on what you enjoy listening to. I recommend trying this app out for anyone who loves music!
5,This is a really stable app. Great selection of mainstream music and has the option to import your own into your playlist! Excellent app that I use often while gaming.
1,Always a problem always songs missing in the repertoire... Every important song from older albums is missing Edit: its still bad: there is a section in the app specifically designed for the songs you like from chosen artists. That playlist adds extra songs in it. Example: if I go on an artist like 2Pac there are songs from him that I enjoy so I click on like. However there are other songs that dont even have the liked song icon on it but are in the playlist. Whats the point? Shame!
5,Great app and easy to use. Very convienient to have music always avaliable and great to be able to download songs when the internet is not avaliable.
1,Songs are great but after a while the audio started glitching. Audio sounds like a scratched record. I had to uninstall it a reinstall it for it to work right...
5,(I had I iTunes before and I wish this app gets as good as iTunes... dont get me wrong I love a few features from this app but it could be better....) That was my previous comment about this app now Im much more happier than before since you guys introduced the lyrics I love it so much... thank you guys for listening my advice..
4,I like that Spotify has given the option of Equalizer. I use it to tune my music to make it pleasing for me. However these days it keeps reverting to default tuning.
1,Worst app. If not for JRE Id not use it but almost impossible to use for its basic functionality at times. Will totally screw up what is being played and/or start another podcast youve been playing over.. just fix the app and maybe people would subscribe
4,Great App but at some point the ad kills the patience to listen to a song... Ads are okay but it should be displayed at the beginning of song rather than displaying before jumping to another song...! After all Great app for Podcasts and Songs!!!
2,This was my top music app because I could use this app while using others without paying...UNTILL they started playing recommindations on my playlist! They should install an option if you want there recommends So I went back to youtube
1,This whole set up with this company is a joke. You can not cancel as easy as they say. For the last 4 months Ive been paying for premium service and only getting regular service but they sure is that aint sending my money back I would not recommend this to anybody Im fighting right now to try to get out of this and they wont let me discontinue the service so I dont know well see if they charge my card again Ill be suing them soon
5,Great app the free version is great. I do have premuim but with the free version you can still do lots of things. Premuim lets you download and have no ads (top two things of premuim.) But you still dont need premuim I got it as a gift. Spotify overall: 5 stars for me!
1,Lately theres an annoying bug that will randomly pause whatever youre playing. Seeing as how I mainly use Spotify during dog walks in the frigid Canadian winter this is quite an painful annoyance. No information Ive found online has fixed this problem. Otherwise fantastic streaming service and when it works it works great.
1,New update has removed almost all my downloads again. Why it removes leaves a few albums but remove over 6000 songs is frustrating especially since I live off grid and have to use cellphone data. I am actively looking at new music apps. Why pay for a service that does not explain or give any reason or recourse to fix this ongoing problem and although I can stream and download video on other apps spotify only sporadically allows me to download songs.
5,Always great! Havent had any issues. One request I wish I would get a notification when I am playing a song or podcast that hasnt been downloaded.
3,What the hell is the purpose of offline music if youre going to delete them all after updating the app or before renewing my Premium! Now I have to buy cellular data and download 1000 hq songs. Do some better programming!!!
4,still doesnt recognise local files wastes data on streaming when you have the tracks already. edit: current update recognises local files you still cant read them in place of tracks on playlist.
1,Had premium spotify for years. But I realized that you have just removed the car mode and replaced with car thing. So the always on screen not same as the old version except you buy spotify car thing devices. Thank you now Im considering to stop my premium account
1,Had Spotify for years but lately its almost unusable. I regularly update my phone and the app but it refuses to play selected podcasts or songs often. Randomly pauses playback constantly forgets where you have left a podcast if this continues I will just cancel my family subscription after a good few years of use.
4,The only bad part is that the algorithm pulls the same five artists for your suggested page. So while you might like two different genres Spotify will just mix them up in two different playlists with the same songs. Buy premium is worth it to not have ads every two minutes.
1,Broken app takes forever to load most content never show cant play anything takes forever until I give up... the driving experience is the same titles dont show or stay loading forever. When Im lucky enough to get something playing random tracks dont play or just get stuck. Removed 500 times and installed again works fine for a couple of minutes and then goes back to the same. Unusable on my Android device.
3,Alright good work Spotify the latest update that came brought some new aesthetical looks the whole player bar got reworked it looks better. Love the design. Also Spotify feels smoother but they still havent made it so that Android users have the swipe drag features that iPhones do to queue songs. Would be quicker and easier overall usage. A huge tip for the next Wrapped is to make it actually funtional for Android users. Should be obvious. With users and android users increasing each day.
1,I loved Spotify before the update. However after this update the ratio of ads vs songs is unfair. I spend most of my time listening to commercials rather than my music. Also the chance of getting 30 minutes free has gone way down. Please just fix the amount of ads before and after songs.
3,The music suggestion is so poor. It automatically plays 3 same songs no matter what genre I was listening to then at the end of the year it will tell me this song was played for X minutes. Well of course it was played so many times if the app itself plays it automatically. Instead of new albums and songs to discover it recommends me songs I already gave like to. Yall get some help with your suggestion mechanism.
1,Couldnt get any worse... Its been days the app has been showing No network connection. Only the previously played songs would play again. Cant search for songs nor play different ones. Once You uninstall then you can no longer log in. Amazing job guys. Keep it up.
1,Not worth paying. Audio quality is worse than Apple Music and it doesnt connect to my car properly. No artwork on the display audio seems lacklustre even with settings changed and it froze my iDrive. Issues the iOS version and Apple Music app doesnt have. Cancelled subscription.
4,The app is great and so sound quality but sometimes it show offline even if my internet is working properly and the biggest problem and just recently it occurred was that some of thing that are uploaded on the app are so explicit and extreme rubbish
4,Deleted this app years ago because of bad music matching. Got it again for my podcasts. It has everything plus all the old episodes. Great for podcasts!
1,This is the 3rd time Ive given Spotify a 1 star rating. Every other has been deleted. If you like listening to ads this is the app for you. If you like music or podcasts look elsewhere.
1,Complete garbage when I click a song it does a different one and apparently it works on computer all right itll work on bloody YouTube and I cant even manually choose songs from my place list and random songs are playing in my playlist 6 skips in a few hours might as well go on YouTube image tiktok you had to wait an hour to skip 6 clips U dislike I dont recommend Spotify use another device or YouTube music and they manually add songs to Ur playlist and when U deleate them another comes :wastebasket:?
5,I love this app! I was previously using Pandora but Im glad I switched over. Without premium the ads are a bit annoying but other than that its fine. And now with premium everything works very well. The audio is high quality and the new update that includes lyrics is very cool
1,i have a handful of songs i like to put on loop when i fall asleep but it keeps adding songs to the freaking playlist. tried adding duplicates it doesnt help any less than 15 individual songs and it adds more. im done with dealing with it uninstalling the app and downloading the songs off of youtube and doing it oldschool. and yes its for the free verion only but some of us cant afford premium because of a little something known as being poor.
1,The UI for playback is total garbage and always glitchy. Im only here for Rogan and Im unhappy with Spotify. Half the time the video doesnt even show up and its just audio. Horrible app
4,Amazing and undoubtedly one of the best music apps out there. Just a suggestion add a feature where when you click on any line of lyrics the song starts from there.
5,Its phenomenal...The recommendations and variety of audio it touches is very good and the lyrics with share option is cherry on top. Good work. You may add 3D songs too..
3,Functional but setting the order of music is not easy. And for some reason the six albums/pieces that I _first_ selected after installation months ago are still the six recent selections.
3,Good music app but still a bit frustrated about the experience. The recommendations are not really relevant. Spotify always pushes the same songs like an annoying radio playing 20 times a day the same song. Also user cant choose they preferred location means you dont have easy access to the music from your country if you live abroad.
1,Spotify sucks I hate it it used to be good but as soon as they got greety it became terrible I have used it for awhile now and it used to be way better I think they need new management or the current management needs to become better at providing good service to people obviously they added limited skips just so they could make more money off of premium Im going to change music apps and use something better and you should too
4,Since the last update its been quite glitchy. The screen wont show what current song/podcast is playing it will show the last one I was listening to. At times it would also stop playing when my screen would go black. Other than that I love Spotify.
5,:raised_hands|type_4::raised_hands|type_4::raised_hands|type_4::raised_hands|type_4:. It is relatively less costly gives you lyrics consumes less data and the app has classic graphics. It is actually the best music streaming app. Thank you Spotify.
3,Its great but lately its been acting up like the song/podcast playing isnt what is actually playing which makes it absolutely impossible to control and its obnoxiously annoying. I have to Uninstall and reinstall it for it to go back to normal then a few more days and back to the way it was.
1,Nothing works. Works fine on PC and PS4 but not at all on mobile. Not exaggerating it played 5 back-to-back ads before I closed the app. Cant shuffle anything cant listen to a single song
1,It crashes about 2 days after each update starting to get on my nerves. Update on my review I am currently looking for a new way to listen to podcasts. App always malfunctioning. Not one Update or anything to correct it. Cheers Spotify. Im having to delete and install the app multiple times a day so I can listen to more than 15 minutes of a podcast. This is BS
3,Premium is like heaven but they literally like torture you if you use free. Unwanted songs and limited skips to force you to listen to garbage and long ads. I could list many others but I would give 5 to the premium version: decent price but costs something and a 1 star to free
1,Unskippable ads on podcasts even though I pay for premium are unacceptable. Also skipping a 3hr long podcast 15s at a time is useless. Get your act together. Acceptable music player. Absolutely terrible podcast player.
5,Awesome has all the songs that I am looking for the family plan is really good because it can have multiple multiple profiles and have a ton of playlists that have like 80 or more songs on them its just a great app and I totally recommend it and they have stuff for kids too so it definitely a perfect app for families and even like one people because its has a lot of good songs on it and you can even look up a clean version if you need to. And one of the best parts are that there are NO ads!
2,Constantly pausing or crashing. About every 15 min. have to restart playing content. Sometimes it goes back to the beginning on podcasts and you have to refind where you were to continue. 3 months later still the same. Random pauses and crashes.
1,This app is garbage now. Whats up with this playing suggested songs and never playing anything off the actual playlist?? Gonna play 6 songs that are not even from the same band let alone from the album Im trying to listen to. Spotify is trash.
3,6 skips for one hour? Thats down way bad why do we even need premium to have that? I mean that ads are okay but the skip thing annoys me to the max. I am picky sometimes and I usually choose some songs to listen depending on my mood so yeah I think the skips arent okay. The only reason why I would give this application three stars is because of the new music that it recommended to me in certain genres.
1,i am genuinely very disappointed in the ads they come way too often and at the worst moments. i was about to cry but the ad came or i was crying and got interrupted by the ad whatever the case still bad. I cannot express enough how much i hate the fact that you have added these ads and i hate them with my whole heart and i hope you stop them. no i wont buy premium i dont have money for that dont even think about mentioning it. just never dare put ads again they are a very bad experienceto
2,The app is fine the problem is you search a song and it shuffles it in with a bunch of other songs. I just want to listen to the one song I searched.
5,It is nice because you can listen to music that you like. It also picks out some songs that you may like from your past history inside the app.
3,Nice useful app however sometimes not user friendly like when it gets stuck showing a previous song or podcast and doesnt show the actual songs playing. A bit annoying.
5,Excellent sound.Being a musician myself this app is a treasure finding specific titles.Random play will take you to tunes you havent heard for decades. Being an Old School Master( the name of my band) You couldnt find a better app for certain types and times for music.
1,I make playlists to listen to what I want. that what playlists are. Not to Spotify! They add random songs I dont even like to the playlists I made and its not 1 or 2 its like at least 5
2,Latest update broke the app. Now randomly pauses and wont resume at that song rather goes back to another song thats already been played from that playlist numerous times
3,Some things dont make much sense to me like songs from playlists & how u cant really listen to an individual song but instead u have to listen to songs like this
1,It used to work excellent in the car through Android Auto but since the last update it will not connect at all. I tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it but it still wont connect. Every other app on my Samsung S20 phone works perfectly on Android Auto except Spotify. It still plays on the phone and also with Bluetooth
4,Functionality is pretty good. Seems to be a resource hog at times and will not work if I have any other apps open. Wish they would pay artists more. Overall the most popular music app so yeah.
4,Love spotify been a user for years its a great platform. I do feel like if we are unable to pay premium for a certain month we shouldnt have to cancel the subscription to use the free version while our premium is awaiting payment
3,Good app but Im pretty mad they cancelled the family subscription with no notice when the card didnt go through. I went and checked my email spam and trash to double check they hadnt sent a thing saying hey your card was declined you have X amount of time to remedy this or your subscription will be paused. Nope just hey were dropping you like a hot potato. Have fun.
1,Spotify your advertisement with offensive language has lost you several long time listeners. I would never pay for a membership in the future. I was listening to a Spotify Mickey Mouse playlist with my toddler and the Spotify company advertisement said G.D. in it. It was so incredibly inappropriate and offensive certainly not needed to promote your company. We are removing the app from all of our devices.
5,A very awesome. Radio. I really love Spotify. And all the things it can do. My favorite. Radio station. You disserve 5 stars. Thank you for playing great music. And your App is so awesome. Mr Patton.
2,Constantly desyncing from Spotify on other devices. I mainly use this app to control Spotify on other devices and sometime last year they screwed up the cross-device functionality so it often wont function properly.
4,This app has some of the best features Ive ever seen. Perfect for those who are ever-engaging with the genres they love. That being said there are a multitude of performance issues as well as some annoying bugs that do not appear to be fixable via the documented solutions. An easy 5-star if these get fixed.
3,Forced to play setlists in random is awful. There are reasons why songs are in a certain order. Something is lost. Its like ordering a margarita and drinking all of the ingredients separately. Its just not the same thing.
4,I would give it five stars but I hate when it starts playing random songs that arent on my playlist instead of my playlist. It can get annoying sometimes
2,I still stand by 2 stars. Cant see the active song it just glitches to the same random song I dont know. Cant play radio stations noticeable if its even a feature anymore. Also whenever I turn my truck off and get out Spotify resumes on my phone playing a loud like I was taking the groove with me. STOP THAT! SICK OF ALL THESE BE NAME APPS BEING BROKEN!!! SPOTIFY YOUTUBE MUSIC PANDORA what in the fuN are you guys doooing?
5,Love Spotify. Was a firm Pandora listener for a long time but the app started crashing so much I couldnt listen to music. Begrudgingly switched to Spotify... I will never go back. :sweat_smile:
4,Spotifys service is a staple for me but what would make it OH SO MUCH better is the ability to make Album Playlists. Call them Collections or something. It would be a game changer. Imagine being able to follow The Rolling Stones Top 500 Albums of 2003 without having to surf through every single song?
5,Awesome app to listen ur favorite musicsongs and podcasts Im giving 5 stars because it helped me to be happy anytime everyday everywhere in any device. Its easy to use and I didnt buyed premium u can get more features if u got that. Thank u very much tobthe developers and team for providing this app. :)
4,Pretty great; just missing one thing. When I start a new podcast I like to go from the beginning. This is easy for episode one but can get a bit complicated on the way as I have to sort by date and then by unplayed. If Ive listened to half an episode I have to scroll to find it. It would be really nice to have a feature that just starts where you left off.
3,Great app when it works without bugs. It has a tendency to fail at least 3 times a month even when paying for premium.
1,This app suck lately.. . It used to be good... Now total dissapointment! Wats the point of paying mthly subscription and getting a bad experience. Music keep stopping halfway. App seems to freeze on its own. Unssubscribe done. Uninstalling done.Anybody knows any other music app beside spotify??
1,The decision to Retire Car View without a replacement is concerning. I cannot imagine what they were thinking when they removed the only way to pause/skip songs in the car without pushing the power button and unlocking the phone to try to push a skip button 1/4 the size of a fingernail...
1,The app suddenly stopped working. It wont play anything that I havent already listened to. Its super annoying because Im trying to listen to a podcast at work. I tried uninstalling and installing it again but it did not help.
2,I liked this app until this morning ( Jan 5). I was going in to listen to my music and the app looked very different. I cant listen to specific songs cant go back to the last song. I dont know why this is happening already deleted the app ad got it back. Nothing changed. I also didnt have premium so i still dont know whats happening. Please fix this. I also did not have a free trial.
2,Ive been paying for Spotify Premium for over a year now and its recently been playing my playlists in shuffle order no matter what I do; even after deleting and reinstalling the app. Like itll work properly for an hour then the next day Ill have to uninstall it again. Absolutely not worth the money.
3,Hoping your 2022 resolutions include getting Spotify to work again. I am constantly getting the no internet connection error but have internet to work remotely at home. There is definitely a problem with the app. Judging by the comments there is definitely a problem on your side.
5,Its great thats all I can say. My Spotify wrapped was a bit questionable though considering my top song was one I hadnt listened to in forever and I didnt even like but I can move past that.
5,It is so amazing I love it it is exactly what I hoped for thank you for reading my mind. I have a great experience I had no idea I would fall in love with it Spotify. I definitely recommend it for every one. though I sometimes get jealous :zany_face:. Im enjoying the experience please I missed an offer you gave me earlier on the past few days it had 8 days for me to accept but when I checked I could not find it so please can I have it back I need to accept it. Please. Spotify is the Thing.
3,At first Spotify was working but then it stop for some reason. When I go to my playlist and click on a song it doesnt play the full song it play a quarter of it so please fix that.
2,Its an ok app in the fact that you can find any song but I dont understand why if you dont have premium everything automatically play as in shuffle I find it annoying.
2,I was satisfied for months. But now for whatever reason the app just stops and starts randomly. It also sometimes doesnt show the correct pod cast thats is currently playing at the bottom of the screen.
3,It started off fine but increasingly there have been more and more adds and the enjoy your next 30 minutes of uninterrupted music message is annoying and not true I got a row of adds straight after that message multiple times. The negative outweigh the positive but it is nice to create your own playlist and there is a lot of choice for music which I like
3,The app is decent but its really irritating when it suddenly cannot autoplay song after playing your serched music. Hope thus will be fixed in the future.
4,Very clumsy interface. If one plays a song found through usrr search theres no way to return to a previous list of songs. Radio and Spotify suggestion lists cannot be saaved. Good selection of music (better than YTMuzak Premium) although a bit light on 70-80 fusion & some classical (e.g. Philip Glass). Good sound fidelity.
2,Bugs out constantly stops playing music randomly for no reason. No longer works with my smartwatch. The whole interface is an absolute mess! Could really use some cleaning.
1,Ugly user experience and worst marketing strategy. No proper Usp in the application. I was thinking to buy their service because of good Playlists but the way They mock you to buy their premium. I have uninstalled it and bought youtube music subscription instead. Spotify should learn something from Google they never mock you they just remove the important features and once you start missing them you buy them. Thats how you sell something.
3,Everything is great and i have been a premium subscriber 3 times but whenever the subscription is over always shows ad which i know that every app do a promotion for their premium products or other things but the problem with Spotify is there is a ad which is very offensive in my opinion.So simply what the ad say is you need to buy premium as always but it also says that youre not a music fan just because you havent buy premium.I mean it seriously make no sense.............
1,Im a premium member and Spotify had been working perfectly well However recently it shows in the app that Im offline even if Im connected to a stable internet connection So i cant search any new song very annoying since Im paying for your app Respond ASAP :face_palm:
5,I tried switching to other apps due to the price jump when my student discount ran out but nothing else compares. This is the best music app and so helpful for finding new music
1,Without a doubt the (consistently) least functional app that I work with. Somehow there is an ENTIRELY NEW glitch nearly every time I open the app. Absolutely pitiful on all fronts. Edit: Still absolute trash.
4,The Ads. They are more than any other music app. Decrease them before I uninstall the app. I just use it bcz I have already made a playlist on this but the interruptions are crucially time-taking.
5,Had Spotify for years on premium and had no troubles. The new property lyric feature is awesome! The only neg I have is the My shazam songs dont go straight to the playlist even though I have it linked but probs a shazam problem. Beside that happy with the app it cover legit nearly every song. Only a tiny handful of songs I couldnt find
5,My experience was the best it felt like I was in real life concert when I was just hitting in my bed I played it why I was on my video game and why I was doing other things I love the sounds and the music that they display please download it immediately its the best thing Ive ever thought of downloading I dont use no other apps except for this to listen to music download it now its the best
4,Finding music was good however playlist options could be simplified. I love that yoou put advrtising at the begining and give 30 minutes of music uninterrupted. Thanks Kim
1,Usually its been really good. Spotify premium. But lately whenever I open a playlist it will try to load but the loading circle never goes away and it never ends up loading the playlist. So then I just open YouTube! I looked for updates and there is no updates to update. Im thinking I might just cancel Spotify premium.
1,Worst music app there are a number of ads as compared to songs. Its hard for me to understand whether I am listening to songs or Advertisement :joy::joy:. Ratio of Songs: Advertisement 40%:60% Wanted to give 0 star but there isnt not a option I think
2,Music selection ok but gets repetitive and only seems to stick to a relatively limited selection of songs by any particular artist (unless you listen to a playlist that is purely that artist). The most annoying thing is that the ads are significantly louder than the music intrusive patronising (especially Spotifys own ads) and excessive. There is also no way to customise ads. I get ads are necessary but I will NEVER give money to this company given their obnoxious and abusive ad tactics.
1,Cant listen to what you want just plays any old song in a library and loads of 30 second adverts cant listen to what we want and cant even view playlists properly and theres no way Id pay �9.99 a month for this I might be tempted to give it a try at �5 a month but dont think its worth anywhere near �9.99 and for that price the developers dont even reply to any of the comments on here that Ive seen so far. Im new to Spotify and cant believe how messed up this app is.
1,Why make it so difficult to remove the navigation bar that appears when playing music? I clicked a playlist didnt like it but now it will show up every time I open this app until I click on another playlist/song which will also remain visible its waste of screen space when you could have easily allowed users to stop playing the playlist/song :unamused:
2,I have lost my podcast on multiple occasions while in the middle of an episode then I have to find my place again. The only reason I give more than 1 star is the music algorithm but I can find better at other places.
4,I prefer spotify above all others because it has more English and foreign songs than other apps and even with ad included version this app is best I dont bother watching or listening its ads as I m a free user keep it up spotify :hugging:
5,I love Spotify...Every Artist I have ever looked for has been on this app gives recommendations for similar music. I have been introduced to Artists I have not heard of and in turn expanded my musical taste.
1,Considering stopping my subscription due to the quality of this app. I shouldnt have to restart the app/my phone multiple times a day because the app just decides not to play music the one thing its supposed to do. 2 years later and I still have this issue daily. Ridiculous
1,Absolute shite controls always lock adds constantly run. Constant interruptions i never use it Plus you ruined the joe rogan podcast for me. Lies about watching video to allow for 30 minutes uninterrupted listening watch this add then plays more adds after is play fist add. More adds then music selection Plus they ruined JRE
4,spotify is a good app to listen to music! i would really recommend this music app but im giving it 4 stars because sometimes when i listen to music and im in another app it fully stops playing the music so the app is closed. please fix this bug.
1,Spotify only has mainstream songs so you can only listen to songs youve heard a million times on the radio and everwhere else. Also is not worth it unless you buy premium. Its an amazing app IF and only IF you have premium. Otherwise its conplete trash.
2,Well done Spotify you made your free version so awkward and annoying to use that I did not resort to your paid service as intended. Instead I have uninstalled and I would rather use ANY music service over yours. Nice to know that your greed vastly outweighs all other aspects of your service. Would not recommend. Would not use again. Petty annoying awkward.
2,I very much dislike it now I cant choose the song I want to play without getting premium I cant skip songs either without paying for premium and now I can only shuffle my playlists and sometimes it adds songs that I havent added its so stupid now. please fix it
5,Pretty good streaming music app wish you could specifically select the song you want to hear from any given playlist like you can on the desktop version.
4,Use Spotify every single day. Love this app. They rarely have any songs I cant find and have a huge range of podcasts too. Wish you could comment on artists pages and songs though. Also wish you could leave reviews on podcasts. I use Spotify Premium. Wouldnt use the Free version as its a lot more limited. The ability to download playlists with premium means I save a lot of mobile data.
5,Im a non-premium user but I really like this app over other alternatives like Amazon Music and SoundCloud as this is the original source. If you dont mind the ads Spotify is amazing!
1,So buggy its unuseable. Most of the time you cannot pause or change music and have to keep restarting the app... They should pay people to use their garbage app its not even worth it if it was free.
5,Awesome app and service even with commercials! Its a shame that as a Quebec resident I cant use their promotions. I would gladly pay for their content but dont think its fair all other provinces in Canada recv 3 months free. Cest triste mais - cest la vie!
3,When connected to Android auto it will play a few songs then it will start stuttering. I then disconnect restart and it will happen again. Any suggestions
4,the comparison Ive inadvertently done between Spotify & Tidal has come to an unexpected clear winner. Tidal may sound slighty better but Spotify has more of the music I love and even if only free Ive noticed Spotify having more of what I love than Tidals more limited lossless audio selection which disappointed me with its lack of my favorites this Christmas.
1,Its gotten to the point where its not even enjoyable using the free version of Spotify. Try to get free 30 minutes? Watch atleast a good minutes worth of ads just to not get 30 minutes of free music. Then the first song playing isnt even in the Playlist.
2,My debit card was lost and I missed a payment. Added new card and I was upgraded to premium duo though ever since downloading this app I have always used premium. Had to log in to the website version to change back to my usual version. Was a hassle and sneaky not Spotify to do that. Enjoy that additional $3!!! Whilst I am at it the navigating of podcast is ridiculous not to mention you still get ads in your podcasts despite Parcast states add free and exclusive to Spotify...pfftt.
1,Kinda hate Spotify now... After update its so uneasy to use!!! Like how am I supposed to click the only SONG I want!? I just want it to play again in one single song but instead it went to other song that I COMPLETELY DOESNT WANT TO VIBE WITH! please! Dont do it more confusing for us to use... Im sorry but I deleting this apps completely a mess after updates
4,Love the app but have issues with songs stopping abruptly once in awhile. Cant do anything to fix it just have to wait awhile for everything to play correctly.
1,Used to be great. But the ads are intense. Blth visual and every 3rd song. May as well name it adsify. I understand ads pay for apps that are free. But seriously if the ads have links and i follow the link. Whats the point. And why is the phone functionality better than your web-version. Why cant both be the same
3,Have this app for a long time but recently I am having some dumb issues. I will have the app randomly close out which it also brings other problems. Even when I open it back up it does not keep track of the time on a podcast. When I change podcast it says Im still playing the one it crashed on. Had to uninstall Spotify and redownload it to fix it but it has done it again. SPOTIFY PLEASE FIX THIS BUG!!!!!
4,One of the best streaming platforms! I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I cant get the lyrics feature at Now Playing even though Ive tried things like clean reinstall.
1,This App sucks so hard. Disconnects during every episode takes over 20 minutes to reconnect pain-in-the-*ss to skip adds/forward AND I GOT HACKED like I have never been hacked before
1,Not sure how you guys manage to have a working amazing music app but then manage to completely break it with updates every other year....meanwhile the updates literally add no value to the app...if it aint broke dont fix it is a nice concept to revisit. Spotify is amazing when it works.
4,For such an extensively used app  I expect things to be done in imperfection.unfortunately I still find myself occasionally in odd situations of going from corner to corner to find a setting  function or even playlist. This is not ok. More usability study needs to be done done for Android users imo.
3,I am 100% sure this is the worst music app I ever used . Nothing good about it . Full of adds you can never play the song you search and a lot of other shity stuff . Never recommend this to someone
1,Seriously it works wayyyyy better on my TV. Every time I try to play a certain song... Lets say Merry Christmas everyone for example. If I try to play the song it ends up playing something completely different. I play that song and it starts to play random rave music instead of the one I specifically told it to play. Its very annoying but it doesnt do this on TV though. So many ads as well but I dont want Spotify premium.
5,Absolutely some of the best content out there in one place. A little quirky in the operational side of things but the content cones through with patience and its worth it.
2,Ive been using Spotify for long time and Ive got to say the latest updates really ruined the whole experience. The ads are fairly tolerable but the limited controls make no sense whatsoever. Random songs I have never heard of keep playing limited skips frequent crashing etc. Theres honestly no point in using this app comfortably anymore.
4,Everything about this app is brilliant! I only have one complaint. I experience it quite annoying now with the new enhance function that I have to find the song in my playlist to delete it rather then just simply be able to delete the song through the play window.
2,its glitchy the app becomes unresponsive and the banner of whats playing gets stuck on my podcast or on a certain time on the podcast and when it does no matter what I put it on it still tells me its playing the podcast at and the time stamp doesnt change nomatter what. also when the timestamp freezes its annoying because I listen to hr long podcasts Id be less critical but this wasnt happening before I was a paying member and Im not pleased. it stays broke till I un/reinstall
1,Yes definitely 1 star it is a superfreak on ads when I am listing to 1 or maybe 2 songs and its really not that long a ad already. And sometimes the songs stop :hand: by itself and pauses by itself and is so laggy please tell me if any has these problems
4,Its a great applove itone of my longest used music apps..buut one problemsince I got this new phone I cant choose the song I want to listen to. ONLY shuffle play..like I wanna listen to my liked songs but I cantI can only listen to a short preview which sucks...I dont know if this is on purposeeither way Im letting you know
1,I love Spotify but recently it doesnt open for me it doesnt load any songs Ive been paying for it for the past few years and Ive been paying for it recently and I havent been able to use it whats really going on with its does anybody know why Spotify is not working uninstalled it and reinstalled it and nothing
4,Using spotify free very happy with range of music podcasts etc ads arent too intrusive but would prefer a greater range of ads as they often play the same ones back to back.
5,I love Spotify. Anytime I even hear a song in a movie I look it up on Spotify and find it to add to my playlist. Works very well! I pay $10 for no commercials and my playlist. Worth every penny.
5,I love this app but theres ONE problem. Ads. Everytime I try to relax and listen to music an ad comes up and its annoying.
5,Absolutely great experience. The recommendations are crazy.:heart_eyes: Great volume. Great Daily Mixes. My absolute favorite music app. Nothing beats Spotify. Worth every dime I could ever spend.
3,Thus app is glitchy. Lag time is atrocious and when Im driving in a car I cant get video. Most of the time it will kick me off my JRE podcast and when you go back you cant find out where you were. It loses your place. Needs work to say the least.
4,The app is pretty good only when you have premium because as child I couldnt pay to get premium so instead I just had to deal with two ads that would be 1 minute long and if youre lucky 30 seconds which I wouldntmind if they werentso frequent something else is that you cant actually choosewhat songs you can play since youreonly option is the shuffle button. I would only recommend if youre willing to pay for premium.
2,App never keeps up with what song Im on in a playlist when i play through Alexa and its been that way for 2 phones now so its definitely the App! Have to force stop the app just to get it to work again
1,I wish i could give this app negative stars. Horrible app all i want to do is listen to a podcast nope it lags and buffs. I restart my phone and sometimes itll play without lagging but lately its lags even if i restart. Terrible app. I used to watch every joe rogan episode i think ive watched 3 since he switched to this terrible company
1,Ive been paying premium for a very long time 10+ years to avoid ads and it looks like now even if you pay for premium they still push ads noticed a few short ads pop up on podcasts. I dont want ads its the reason I pay there is absolutely no other reason why anyone would pay premium other than to stop ads. So if youre reading this review and trying to determine whether or not to use Spotify my suggestion to you is to look at alternatives as Ill be looking at alternatives.
4,On of the best music app. But the problem is you cant download music. Like wink and the the app called rasco. I know you cant do this but still you may allow to downlood a limited music
2,Glitchy. Skips like a CD when you open the app or any app or move a couple feet or really just whenever youre enjoying it. The consistency of this app is really wearing on me. Not the worst money I spend but definitely not the best... Sometimes :eye_roll:
5,Recently I have been noticing that when I pick songs they play for 8 seconds and just stops. It doesnt start playing again and if you try skipping back or forward in the song it still doesnt play. If you skip to the next or previous song they maybe do the same thing but if you go back to the first song and try playing it it will not play at all. Does anyone know whats happening or if there is a solution?
3,The apps great:relaxed:? but i dont really like the update cause usually it doesnt have any ads and when you go in to the artist album you cant click at the song you want any more . And every time i listen to the song the ads always pop up Please fix this ?
5,Im really enjoying my student discount for years now. Really have a great music experience. I just wish that the share lyric option is available for me too.
3,I use the app for podcasts. Every 5 to 10 minutes th podcast stops playing. Part way through a podcast the podcast will stop and change to another episode. Good app but annoying sometimes
1,Ads problem. It says Ads after 30 minutes learning but ads comes after 2 or 3 songs. So it feels boar to use this app. They cheat us. I feel very bad to use this app.
2,Never have I thought Id ever be more aggravated at an app thats meant for playing music than I am now I am trying to listen to a singular song in the background since I couldnt do it on YouTube and it is recommending me 30 other songs and not playing the one song I want it to
3,Enjoying it. But the fact that you cant click on artist and just see a list of all their songs drives me crazy. Everything is split up into the albums. I just want an option to see one big playlist of all their music on the artists page.
5,Its very good and enjoyable it make me never worry about latest song again i can play any new or old song i heard about but the new update in the app is that you can search for a particular song or preview and repeat.
2,Having a hard time keeping the offline songs stored on my SD card. After restarting my phone I had to login to the app again and some of my settings were reset for no reason.
1,Spotify has stopped working and is not logging in !!! It works very poorly with alexa devices ! It lags like anything And now it has send me out of my premium account and asking me to log in  inspite of trying several times the logging is failing
4,Everything is fine it is just Mayne yall should make premium not so over priced. Like add a 1 year plan for 15% off or if you have been subscribed for a certain amount of time you get 1 month free. Most apps that have subscriptions have these kinda of things and it is disappointing without them.
4,Nice and flexible plans depending on the need. Almost every song you can think of can be found here. Love the service. Recent ads arent too bad as well..
1,It used to let me pick my songs as of a week ago and now it has a bs shuffle and it wont even play anything close to the song I like nor want for example picked sea shanties and non are the old for of folk sea shanties were it just singing with claping stomping and sometimes a eqorden idk but it gone down the pipe I would have given it 5 stars if I keep it the old way but it now sucks and that putting it nicely Id suggest sound_cloud at least it gives u the songs u ask for or something close
3,Whats the point in ads Id give it a five star but last year 2021 it usually just never plays an ad. No idea why but since its 2022 ads randomly started playing. Every music I listen to and ads starts after a song ends..
1,The app lies. I tried listening to an ad to get 30 minutes ad free and got an ad 4 minutes later. Update: Now it doesnt do the 30 minutes ad free at all. This app is such a pain to listen to music.
2,Nice app I guess but... I Usually Listen to this podcast called Spooky Korean tales but ever since Ive paid premium i cant listen to it the play button wont work but it does for other podcasts and songs
3,I really enjoy using this app but ever since the new version was updated i cant play an album without seeing the indiviual songs in there. If there is any way that i can change it i would really love that :grin:
3,The ads are getting worse now. Like i understand that we need to get premium to remove ads completely but i cant afford that. There used to be 30 mins interval but now they come every 2 mins with the annoying ads :face_palm|type_1_2:???. Please stop
4,Took on the special and so far their recommendations havent been perfect but music is somewhat easy to find from around the world. Hope they stay affordable
5,I LOVE IT!!! What a great App with a vast variety of music. :notes: Something for everyone. When I first downloaded Spotify I spent hours just looking for and listening to my favorite tunes. Needless to say I was very pleased. Im so glad my son told me about this app. Spotify also gives me 30 minutes of ad free listening just for watching a short video. Its wonderful. I LOVE :heart:? SPOTIFY!!! Thanks Spotify for this great App. KUDOS :+1:
1,THEFT! I got signed up for a promotional thing for a month and canceled it because I dont use Spotify enough I listen to YouTube more. Well I just realized theyve been charging me $ 10 for months and I still have commercials when I do listen. Therefore I never thought I was officially canceled. In my account it says Im not subscribed. Bug they still charge me monthly. I guess SCREWING THE LITTLE GUY is how they pay so much to these big content creators.
2,Spotify is a good app dont get me wrong but the things wrong with it are very apparent I turned off auto play so only the music in my playlists get played and Spotify still plays music outside of them I even hidden them from said playlist and it doesnt he get hidden. Not only that but sometimes Spotify doesnt play a song all the way through or it stops in the middle of the song so I have to skip it. Its really frustrating and stupid. Live laugh love Spotify tho just wish these were fixed
4,Signed up for premium but it didnt take. Might have been my mistake. Great sound great library to choose songs from!
3,Its good for podcasts(current update is terrible constantly pausing or freezing up. Stops current podcast and plays another. Few things need to be fixed) I tried listening to music on it big fail. Click a song and a different one plays can never go back only skip ahead. Commercials constantly. Not a fan of the music side.
1,Nine out of ten days it works fine. One out of ten days the app crashes constantly. Everyday the app struggles when entering orvleaving wifi coverage. Honestly once I find a better option Im out.
1,What kind of app will not allow you to cancel your subscription and also have hardly no way to get a hold of them or sign in to do it? What a sham! I probably paid for extra months because I could not figure out how to manage my subscription because there is nowhere in my account to do so.
1,Bad app if I would be the owner I would rate it a 1 star its really bad you only get 6 skips per hour and the premium price is to big I think you need to fix it so you can skip any song you want even without premium because getting 6 skips per hour is mean and thats why I give it a 1 star
5,Cant praise this app enough Its a way of life Becomes part of your everyday anywhere. Works flawlessly easy to use works on all (my) devices! Music is a memory a feeling this app provides this 100%.
3,Getting glitchier and glitchier. In recent months it has started playing the radio for a downloaded playlist while off wifi. These songs arent downloaded and shouldnt be played. Itll also jump to the radio playlist when Ive only listened to one or two songs from the downloaded playlist. Sometimes itll play a completely random song that isnt on the playlist Im listening to.
5,Ive used spotify for several years now. I will be a user for as long as the service is available. This music app has shown me more new artists and songs than I couldve ever imagined! Ive been a free user and a premium user and I will say the premium is extremely worth it. I dont dont I could go back to free spotify. Overall a wonderful service i use on a daily basis ?
5,I just love Spotify because I have a duo account and the 2 of us share a playlist and can listen to music from each other. Also we can have our own playlists. I like how it plays music recommendations from a specific song as well. I have also found numerous good podcasts to listen to.
5,Its a pretty slick app interface. Music selection has been great and the integration of Sonos control is awesome to have.
2,Ive discovered so many new music through Spotify and its my go to when sharing music with friends but lately its been so annoying when I want to play a different song and it just wont. My app is up to date on updates its not a space issue because my phone has plenty of space left please fix this issue Spotify. Leaning towards canceling my subscription and paying for YouTube if this wont resolve.
2,As soon as you try to get 3mo for free they remove it & try to charge you lol. Every year they advertise that three months free I dont think Ive ever been able to take advantage of it. What a joke. Stick with Google and get multiple services for the price of one.
5,Everything is great and I switched from apple music the only thing they dont have that apple music does is remembering if the user wants their music to be on shuffle repeated playing for the Playlist or repeated song playing.
2,Fix this app. Everytime Im playing music it automatically stops playing then restarts the song completely over. This recent updates are garbage. Bring back old spotify
1,Unstable app through multiple updates different devices android and iOS etc. Crashes freezes lags bugs in playback/pause. The irony of frequent premium account upsells during this experience is poignant; do the crashes stop if I pay a monthly fee?! Doubtful! If it werent for the exclusive podcasts I would abandon Spotify altogether. And neverending pointless recommendations adds etc. Google/Apple podcast apps are superior.
1,The fact that spotify wont allow you to clear your history and start a fresh is beyond stupid. Ive been bombarded with chinese kids songs and no matter what I do I cannot remove them from my suggestions despite blocking artists as many artists and songs as possible. All I want is to reset my account but apparently its not possible so Ive been left with no alternative but to cancel my family subscription and look elsewhere for my music spotify is an utter disgrace.
5,Great app user freindly lots of different bands and genres the only thing is you cant select multiple songs at once which makes making new playlists hard.
2,app hasnt been functioning properly since a while ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times but none of the cover arts are loading and my playlists are taking too long to download kindly look into this :/
2,Look I got the ads part but not being able to restart the song or not being able to skip tracks for another 30 mins? Are u kidding? That just makes peopel wanna delete the app instead of paying for premium.
1,Something wrong with this app. Try to connect it on my tv and it takes forever i also need to uninstall it on my phone but doesnt help anyway whats wrong??? I hope you can fix this problem because its just a waste of money if you dont..
5,Great sound quality. Before using this app I used to play songs from YouTube but when i switched over to this app the sound quality is much much better than it was on YouTube. Hatsoff to developers for making this one of a kind app.
1,Used to be a good app but now I cant play my playlist. Its just an infinite loading screen and when a playlist DOES play several songs wont play and when I skip one song itll skip like two or three
3,I love the app but auto play sucks even if i turn it off it still plays songs that arent in playlist please fix this issue and when i search a song and try to play it gives me a playlist and i have to got through half of it before i can find the song i want i also hate that if im just being dumb can u please explain how it work cause it keep giving playlist instead of the song
4,Pretty good experience Ive had with this app. Good sound quality and not many glitches. Great to also use on PS4 (I get less ads on it for some reason). Also has backround play for free on all devices. A nice app
1,Not sure what happened but it now periodically freezes/stops the audio while I am listening to podcasts. Overall its a great platform but this glitch is really annoying.
1,App is quiet good but so many usless and irretating ads forcing to purchase premium version!! Its too disgusting thing Ive experienced. Pls dont put too much ads here those who are interested will purchase the premium version why are you forcing them!
2,THANKS FOR THE ADS SPOTIFY IM MOVING TO AMAZON MUSIC B) I wouldve moved to amazon music looong back if i knew i would get it with my prime subscription beforehand. Anyways not coming back to spotify anytime soon the ads are just so annoying.
4,Best app for songs and the most thing I loved in Spotify is its UI its is very easy and so nice :heart_eyes: but the only one negative is its playing often the ads if we play one song also it will play first ads and next only it will play the song and after two songs played it will ads again....:expressionless: Spotify please reduce ur ads
2,Is ok. But false advertising with the 30 min of uninterupted listening. Watched the ad heard 1 song then stuck with 3 more ads. Might as well listen to radio.
1,Horrible player for podcasts. I only got this app to listen to Joe Rogan and another podcast that moved to Spotify. I had used it before but stopped due to app issues. The player either doesnt want to play or stops every 10mins for no reason. Which is annoying during a 3hr. podcast! How does my free podcast player not have any issues but a huge company like Spotify cant seem to figure it out? If I find a way around Spotify Im taking it.
2,I like Spotify but Im very disappointed with the app and Bluetooth connectivity. 99% of times it doesnt start playing music when I connect to my in-car bluetooth radio. Very rarely it does start automatically. Its very annoying and I only use the app in my car. All battery savers for the app turned off still not working.
3,it annoys me how it keeps logging me out for some reason i dont know of. everytime i log back in i then see all my downloaded songs not downloaded???? like i cant listen to songs offline because of this it logs me out resulting in no downloaded songs. its simply annoying.
1,Spotify plz fix the damn issue of songs getting stuck in one playlist. :rage: When I play another playlist or que a song song will not go to that and it will play a song from that stuck playlist.. plz fix it I have to install uninstall multiple times to fix this still keep coming
4,A great app! been using it for the past 2 years and have never had a problem with it until recently though. the playlist I use the most goes for over 24hrs and Ive added a lot of new songs but the hour count stopped going up... is there a way to fix this? Ive deleted the app then reinstalled but that didnt work.
4,Am a big fan. My only concern is how much storage it needs when downloading the songs and playlists. Cause then it needs to update which takes more storage.
5,Besides the ads the music quality is great their collection of Playlist is excellent they have lyrics and their user interface is easy to use
1,I thought spotify was once a really good music app but now with the new update it changed. When I wanna play one song I cannot play it because theres a whole song list and I need to skip to search the one that i wanted to actually listen. Im pretty sure that everyone was okay with the old spotify.
2,Playback over bluetooth is crackling. Its not the bluetooth device or the phone its the Spotify app. Neither reinstall nor clear cache is working to solve this. For a paid service this must be fixed.
1,fraudulent they say subscribe cancel anytime but i wasnt able to cancel a lot of my friends had same issue some got charged they had to close credit cards. beware of this app. do not use. i also just closed my account today.
5,I like using the app but I use other music streaming apps when my account is down. Earlier in the year I lost my account and got it back realizing that all that all the playlists I made along with the friends who would add to the playlists got deleted or I have to search for my old account. Hopefully I find it soon.
5,Great app creates daily playlists that are well made and offers a variety of artists and music. The only downside is that if you dont go premium you are bombarded with adds but I think its worth it
4,It would be nice for it to let me hide certain sections of content or even let me disable them to save bandwidth and keep the app focused on what i want/need. Would also be nice for it to have a song recognition system to avoid having another app for this purpose. Keep improving it. Thanks!
5,The music quality is a pure choice you can make if the wifi or cellular data is low and the audio isnt doing good you can set it to where it will be able to adjust and constantly play.
5,I actually enjoy this music app very much. Makes me feel a complete whole with my tunes. Now its time for a complimenting headset to draw in the complete sound experience.
1,The app keeps suggesting songs that I have hidden. The app desperately needs a dislike button available at all times that will then skip the song no matter what playlist you are listening to. The hide song feature is also available only on certain playlists. Lastly to cancell your subscription you need to login on a Web browser then confirm your cancellation what feels like 100 times before it finally believes you dont want it anymore.
4,I like Spotify the music is great but recently the songs are not changing on the screen car but are changing in Spotify. Can you please tell me if there is a problem with Spotify or is it a software update that has changed this and can this problem be fixed?
1,This is one of the worst apps I ever downloaded. I tried to listen to an album but Spotify forces you to pay premium to listen in order. I dont mid the add but atleast let us choose the songs we want to play. And pls just let us listen to an album in order and not play a different song thats not on the album but from the same artist
3,The app is pretty good unless you use it on a phone. If you use it on a computer or a tablet you can skip as much as you want choose your own songs and skip to any part of the song but on a phone you cannot do any of that you only have 6 skips per hour.
3,I would give a 5 star rating but since I only listen to podcasts (no music). Unbeknownst to me until AFTER I signed up for Premium (wanting no ads) and speaking to several customer service reps I was finally told that the No Ads* only referred to the music portion. So why wasnt that advertised? Better yet how come I spent upwards of a total of 3 hours with Customer Service trying to figure out the why I was still hearing ads when I was listening to podcast ????
1,When playing music it would freeze then I would have to push play all the time. I have the premium subscription sucks when your driving and it keeps freezing. Going back to soundcloud.
5,Coming from a downloading mp3s to player and walkman era having a cloud based music system with algorithms to understand your taste in genres is fantastic in this day and age.
4,So far so good. I have only just begun using it. I wish the daily mixes were more mixed. They tend to be a list of similar songs with a few artists versus a wide variety of types of songs with multiple artists. Otherwise I am pretty happy so far.
3,Ads Problem. I think its better choose Resso.... Because now days its ads are more than songs.. They say that after this ads you can hear 30mins without ads. But after 2or3 songs ads will come again.. So I think Resso is more useful.... because there is no ads problem with that... That is the biggest problem I have seen in this... So I am giving 3 star... If you guyzz can plzz stop showing this much ads.. How much ads you play Those who have cash thay will take primeum. other guys like..?:broken_heart:
1,Latest update seems to have made the app glitchy. Podcasts will randomly stop playing. Now playing screen is stuck on the first thing played since launching the app. Frustrating considering Im paying for Premium.
5,Best audio streaming app ever. Took me 2 years of a subscription included in my Vodafone plan to realise. Now Im fine to pay for it monthly (not like me at all) as their AI is amazing. Best place to find old loved and new amazing tunes.
1,I would give you a 0 but thats not possible so Im giving you a 1 :heart_eyes: It makes you HAVE to get premium on your phone if you want your playlists to play properly. I had a mental breakdown trying to figure out how to use this stupid app This app works way better on desktop and tablets so why make it different on a phone?
3,Constantly crashing and playing the wrong song or podcast episode I choose. I click on one song and it will cycle through others on the playlist or album and not even play whatever it lands on. When it finally does play the right thing the time bar is either wrong or not moving at all.
5,Ive had this app for years and it works great on both iPhone and Android. Its super easy to use and organize. I pay monthly to avoid commercials because its definitely worth it. Theres just no better way to put it. :horns_sign|type_3::ok_hand|type_3:
5,I love using this app but with one slight issue. For some reason some artists wont work on my device and Ive tried reinstalling the app and wont work restarting my device and still wont work. Can you guys please update this issue?
2,Uhm? What is with the random drop in connection to bluetooth/smart speakers now or it just turning off... that definitely wasnt an issue I had before. Fix that please.
1,Terrible I used to have no problem with spotify but now I cant even listen to the song I want to every time I click on my song it brings me to a different song Its confusing I really hate how on mobile you cant put songs on loop unlike laptop or pc. It took me around 15 minutes just to play ONE song because yall wanna change the song to one I didnt pick. Also why you guys saying 30 minute ad free listening but whenever I dont even listen to TWO songs you give me a ad at the end of the 1st
5,This is the best music app in the WORLD! it has all of your songs that you want to listen to and its free with ads. but you can get a family membership or just a membership so you can listen to all of your songs add free! so what are you waiting for? hop into Spotify for free music today.
5,i love this app so much i use it all the time and nothing else but lately its been crashing rly bad. ill open the app and start playing a song but as soon as the song is going my whole phone freezes and i have to restart my phone. because of this i havent used spotify in like 2 or 3 weeks
5,The Spotify app is a great app to listen to whatever music you like from babies up to the elderly there is reggae country rock jazz blues and so on. So if you like your music this the app to have.
1,This app has so manu bugs! All I tried was to change the place to storage my music and has been 3 days since I cant use my Spotify account properly. 5 bugs till now and my solution will be uninstall and install the app again so then I have to download my whole album again! I Hate this!
5,amazing sound but if you dont have premium you get adds during the times where your Expressing your feelings or jaming out so Id recommend getting premium as well as music there is also podcast and Spotify will also be able to remind you beyond that you can make specialised playlist for certain things or search up and listen to pre-existing playlist made by others also it can recommend songs that are similar to your favorites
5,Its good for when you are interested in music and you can use it on a google. I use it everyday and it is easy to develop and you can even become someone (Artist) who puts music on spotify. I am a profile called Matteo Loriente and I have about 20 playlists and 10 followers!
5,I started out with pandora back in the day. I liked its algorithm quite a bit but it lacked the one thing Spotify excels at - playlists. I love being able to horde things like a dragon. The only thing I wish spotify was better at was recommendations based on playlists. I always said pandora was great if you didnt know what you wanted but spotify is great if you do.
4,App keeps stucking. It lags since 1 month while music keeps playing in the background. EDIT- Above lagging problem is solved now. But the app keeps leaving network condition by its own. Please check this issue. My phones new and network operator is also quite good. Then i will consider for 4 or 5 stars as well.
5,Great music. Easy to use. Love the feature to link multiple speakers to an account rather than having to bluetooth directly to your phone.. also really loving the podcasts.
4,The Family Premium Plan is GREAT!!! 6 individual accounts for $15.99! If you love music & want to listen to it wherever you go you need Spotify. You can use it as a free user but you must be connected to the internet in order to listen to your music. All types of music & podcasts so its for any age.
5,Honestly this app is amazing! It allows me to listen to my music ad free for thirty minutes and it allows you to listen without all the bad quality! I bought premium and its even better than you think. You may think Im a robot but Im really not. (Totally not what a robot would say.) No but seriously this app is just awesome and I dont even need wifi to listen to music now that I have premium. It has all your favorite songs! I encourage everyone to get Spotify and buy premium!
5,Spotify does its job. People always seem to complain about little minor things but to have options and pick your favorite music is spot on.
4,Need more options for speed play when listening to a pod cast. Google podcast has 1.3x play speed and many other options. Spotify only has 1.2 then 1.5. We need 1.3 its the perfect speed to listen to podcasts.
5,It has been really good. I kinda wish I could get unlimited skips without spotify premium but other than that it is a great experience.
4,Started playing ads when the app is closed (including forced stop) and even in the middle of podcasts without pausing it. Otherwise its good
1,Went from a decent music streaming service to an awful one these past few months. Spotify wrapped always crashed the app sometimes playing a playlist just goes to radio based on playlist which occurs after the playlist has ended - when its started. Now today it has redownloaded all my songs onto my phone when it was previously stored on my SD card with no warning or reason whatsoever
3,App worked great for a while then it started to stop in the middle of the songs... Dont wanna pay for something that doesnt work. If this issue continues I will unsubscribe.
5,Really great app I would say. I can listen to music whenever I want. No addsno problems. I highly recommend this app to all the music lovers. So convenient and easy to use. But please update it so we can save audio to our phone storage so we can listen to music offline. I would really appreciate it. Other than thatthis app is great. Keep up the good work:blush::+1:
4,I love this app!! But I was hoping that theyd put like more idk how to say this like lol... You can say that its my own preference of music and some of them arent there but yeah!! And also one more thing TOO MANY ADS! Like sometimes Id be listening to 3 adds and after 1 song another ad pops outta nowhere it does get annoying but overall a wonderful app download it if you are a music lover and cant live without music lol!! :joy::+1:
2,Spotify is easy to find not known songs but 30 minutes of free music is a lie! Ill be listening to songs on my playlist and I will want to listen to another playlist or song and I have to watch 2 ads before listening to the song. Or if I create a playlist they add songs to it that they think I like but I dont. I dont know how to remove them or if its possible to remove them.
1,Every time its time to play the ads the app crashes. Also have you all stopped giving 30 minutes of ad free listening because I havent been offered that in a few days.
4,I love Spotify. Its the best. And I cant live without it. But this recent issue frustrates me a lot. Whenever I play a song from my playlist one song after some other songs starts playing even though shuffle is off. Please look into this and I will come back to give it a 5
1,I loved Spotify until I started getting ads after every song. Its so inconvenient. I would rather use mp3 files. Atleast keep a 3:1 song ad ratio. Disappointing.
5,I think Spotify is one of the most welcome App I have for Music and I think it is great it is well worth having everything in music you you will need there is such large choice of music that will cover everyones likes and choice of different music it is a must that you try and have this great experience of SPOTIFY
5,Of all my subscriptions this will be the last I ever leave. All my favourites and lots to discover ranging across all genres including podcasts and more in one place and ad free - incredible.
5,I love the sound quality besides my playlists Spotify suggests great new ones and searching for artists or songs is really easy. The searched song becomes a seed for similar songs. I love it!
5,I love this app! I have several playlists! All the negative ratings Ive read dont seem true! Spotify has not done any of those things to me. Highly recommend!!
4,this app is ok. a few suggestions: a bio option for your profile a more accurate friends listening activity and an actual 30 minute break from ads bc most of the time its like 10 minutes. its also annoying bc my playlists with 200+ songs on it will pretty much only play the same 5 songs without playing any others.
5,This app is no doubt is best music app. You are getting more features in free.you can play music in background. Their is a lrisk also. You can group songs. This is best app for music. Very good work Spotify. I just only hope be like thin only.
3,Spotify was my favourite app to play songs and for some entertainment purposesbut now this app is such a waste and greedy of money and destroyed many peoples enjoyment including mine too. I highly recommend not to download. Only people with premium can enjoy musics without add interference. Such greedy and waste of time.
5,This is absolutely amazing!! I have switched from YouTube/YT Music to this and have absolutely no reason to look back (or elsewhere) for music! It is easy and intuitive and I havent found a song I wanted to hear whos is unavailable.
1,I paid for primium duo...and havent been provided with it...its still showing that Im on free plan...also Ive tried support but theres no option at all...and I have been trying for a refund...but theres literally no option:unamused:
1,Absolutely unacceptable how many hours Ive wasted making playlists only to have them revert to a previous form. Silicon Valley either needs to start paying taxes so we can have functioning infrastructure again or at least recognize not everyone sits on an OC-768 all day. Truly pathetic and obvious sync issue should never happen.
5,Fair price EXCELLENT Musica range and availability. Extremely functional app re: sharing between people and devices! And the logic of the app gives you want you want and enables you to alter as needed. Used to be a YouTube Music fan but not at all anymore. Well done. 02/01/22: issue with my Pixel 4a5G when the phone sleeps it pauses and sometimes resumes playing but I usually have to unlock it. Not conducive to power saving and annoying. Only complaint :grin:
4,I love this app but I would really appreciate two things: 1. Ads: Sometimes ad starts very frequently ruining the mood and sometimes loosing temper. If possible you can fix that so that ads dont play before 30 mins. 2. Lyrics Language: Basically I want to say that there should be an option where we can switch between the Original lyrics and Englsih lyrics of the song. Something like this: Original Lyrics: ??? ?????????? Engliah Lyrics: oshiete oshiete yo sono shikumi wo
3,Is an excellent app...but too many ads! Im almost getting 3-4 ads after each song which is frustrating....I love the app but the ad situation must be fixed
1,Created an awesome playlist but the app doesnt play them. Instead I get random songs of the same genre. Its ridiculous. Turned off autopay and I get the same thing. So frustrating. DELETING THIS RUBBISH
4,This app is great except I am having this bug where when I try to go backwards in the middle of a song it still continues to play the song instead of going back. And vice versa.
5,I will definitely recommend this app for music it has the latest songs available with there lyrics. One of my favourite play list is todays top hits and teen beat . You should definitely check out.
5,super awesome! I can close the app and still do my work! In my opinion it is the best music app I have used so far. sure it wont load every once in a while but it always loads in a few minutes.
1,Im on premium but everytime I played a song it always stopped and start over from the start. Can the developer fix this? Its getting annoying to be honest. I didnt pay for this kind of service. I will edit my review once the issue resolve.
1,One star because Spotify did not fullfil its promise to launch lossless in year 2021. One less star for Lyrics issue. The design of Lyrics layout is not good as compared to other apps. The sync of song with lyrics is not good for many songs. :star::star::star::star: To :star::star::star::star::star: Because Spotify improve lyrics.. :+1:
1,Was pretty neat for a while installed it so I could listen to music I like while playing on my PS4. But as soon as premium ran out the app became close to useless. Apparently listening to one song out of an album is a premium feature. As soon as I finish my playlists this app is getting off my phone
2,Great for listening to music during a drive but some songs will get stuck even though my Internet is fine. It used to be smooth without any interruptions and Im a premium user. Please fix this and Ill give it a 5 stars
1,Yet again!!! Constantly drops out. Cant get more than half way through podcast. Cant use the dashboard because its stuck an episode from 2 hrs ago. So frustrating!!!!
1,Used free trial for a new account I got which I had 3 months subscription for as well andnafter the free 1 month they essentially stole my 3 months that was paid for... when I reach out Twitter the conversation goes in circles with them claiming I cant use it because I used the free one month trial even though it was a 3 month paid subscription... customer service is horrible and have been ignored since Dec. 22 now...
5,I love this app because you can listen to a bunch of cool songs including your favitorite songs or artis i love u so much spotify!! (: the resion i reted the ads a one is because their annoying and because i hate ads alot (:
1,I hate this ap I hate what you did to Google Music that app was perfect. Making me search for the music/podcasts I have downloaded because I know Im about to be without service is ridiculous. Anything less than good wifi or full mobile reception and songs will cut in and out. And the ads. I paid for premium ffs. I hate you with every fibre
2,3 hours into your 5 hours podcast? Spotify will probably switch the episode on you while youre listening then erase your time mark so while youre doing 85mph down the freeway you get your podcast completely interrupted and now you have no idea where you were at. Seriously Spotify if youtube can remember where I was at on a video I havent watched in half a year you could at least remember where I was at 5 seconds ago
3,Spotify is good especially since you can listen to it while the app is closed unlike YouTube. But on the other hand  I wish it would had more content. Some videos dont show  like certain podcast dont have video footage . Other then that good job kids
4,It has almost everything I need in a music app I just wish it was as easy to find unreleased music as YouTube. Aslways room for improvement but a great app all around.
1,the app keeps crashing- Ive reinstalled restarted both the app and my phone Ive tried checking for updates and I am up-to-date. I cant listen to anything.
2,This app was good when I first downloaded itbut as time went on. I descoverd a problem I cant exactly listen to music on itwhat Im saying is that I cant listen or even play the music I want any time I do I dont even know how it might be bc of my phone but it wasnt like that at first so if you can fix that it would be great.
4,I do like spotify once you have a premium account you can get most if not all the songs that you are looking for. The Music quality is always at a very good standard. the songs that spotify Selects for you as songs related to What you are playing are very good and provides you with songs and artists which are new to me and they expand my musical knowledge. The only downer with the Spotify app is that I used to be able to use a DJ app to do mixing. Such a miss. This is the reason for 4 stars.
1,I thought it was good at first but I dont have the ability to play previous songs and I cant even USE THE APP I want to play ONE SONG and it has me play TWENTY It takes 20 minutes to play because it is at the very end Irritating and Thousands of people dont like it because of this. Spotify premium is paying for something that should be free.
3,If youre a paying user the experience is ok but artists get only a tiny percentage of your payment. If youre using the ad supported free service then the interface is terrible. I would recommend using other services - especially if you want to support your favorite artists.
4,Spotify is my main sorts for music! The only issue I have is that it keeps playing the same songs over and over sometimes. But other then that I love Spotify.
2,App opens randomly when I open other apps :-1:love Spotify for listening to music but since the last update it has just randomly started to open and play music mostly when I open other apps my battery is draining so fast as sometimes I dont even realise its playing if Im outside working and cant hear it. This needs fixed or Ill be cancelling my subscription and deleting the app...
1,Spotify wont load any albums or podcast episodes. I tried clearing cache and data unonstalling and reinstalling but whenever I try to go into a artists page or podcast page it tries to load but doesnt loads anything. Completely useless. Im basicly forces to not use Spotify since I cant listen to anything at all.
4,The best music listening program ever made. The only thing I did not like the program missing referral program. It is better making referral program available for customers and offering them some privileges for each attracted person.
1,this app is extremely hard to use its so frustrating i cant even play the song i want even thats complicated Checking and playing songs in a playlist is difficult whenever i search a song and tap play it plays a different song then it just continues with the same song if i try to play a different song
1,Too many adds. Many times I get about 5 adds right at the startup of the app. Many times the adds are repeated 2-3 times in the same add break. Extremely annoying. The app is coming off now...
1,Terrible administration services. I lost my debit card and as a result the default payment didnt work. My account was deleted and I still cant figure out how to get the premium duo setup back even though I spent 25 minutes on chat with so called support. They told me it was fixed and it still is not. The phone application has no facilities to view your account status. You have to go on to a computer in order to try to track down this information. Exceptionally frustrating. And time consuming
1,Car mode has vanished. I use my phone landscape on a motorcycle and car mode allowed me to flick between tracks and playlists. Now the option under car in settings does nothing. I have no interest in car thing. Useless now as cant control music on the move as no way to enable always on full screen mode.
1,Normally ok then for no apparent reason Spotify moves all my data from my SD card to my internal storage? Had the issues fixed several times. Still continues to be a problem. Switching to Tidal.
1,Forward and backward buttons are really broken up in Videos Im seeing JRE video but when I tap on backward button video starts from 2-3 minutes back instead of 15 seconds. Even bigger problem is it shows I went 15 seconds back in timer but video clearly had gone 2-3 minutes back without that time reflecting in timer. Button and video length needs to be fixed its destroying viewing experience.
1,too much ads. and the ads are also too long(not only 1 or 2 but several ads played at the same time) .. its annoying.. This app is only for those who have money .. i am a student and dont have any source of earning so how can i subscribe to spotify premium..
2,I dont like how they changed it to where you can only listen to full songs on playlists if its on shuffle mode and i cant change it on settings.
3,I have been using Spotify premium. Biggest dissapointment is the way the app behaves when you are offline. I downloaded my playlist before my trip so I can listen to them offline. But the app doesnt let me in when Im offline and instead takes me to the login page. Having inconsistent internet connection during the trip meant I could no longer login and access the downloaded songs. Also when I managed to log back in later using a slow internet connection the app tried to download all the downloaded songs again which was not possible with the limited slow internet that I had during the trip. App is not designed to be your travel companion and can be enjoyed only in home where you have proper internet connection. For travel and trips where you need offline access to your favourties playlists Spotify premium doesnt help. Looking at other options.
5,I love Spotify. Had it on my laptop and had to temporarily do away with it. Now I am on the 3 month trial and thought I was supposed to have it on my laptop as well but I still have the one with all the adds. I will be able to afford the Premium again when this trial is over. I cant wait. Why would I use any other music app? Thank you!
4,This is a nice app but if we dont have a premium subscription then it shows add it is ok but it shows you will have 30min of interrupted music but as soon as I start a new song it would pop up a 30 second add but it is ok
3,The app is good. But there are some inaccessible songs. On my phone and laptop I dont get ads but on ipad its a whole new can of worms. The app is randomly closing today. It shouldnt be so. Also ads stop acting like money hungry sharks. You want people to buy premium to be happy not out out of frustration.
2,The app is super glitchy. Currently 1 title is showing of a podcast while other music and podcast are playing while also not showing a time bar at all for the actual music or podcast playing. The app pauses randomly. The app will also randomly exit entirely. Maybe its time to go back to pandora or something
4,Mostly Original soundtracks giving wonderful listening experience. Some tracks arent original soundtrack. One more autovolume is missing. Some tracks arent upto the mark. Equaliser provision is also a better feature.
5,Spotify has all the music I need always up to date as a result I have freed 5GB of storage on my phone. The fact that you can find local music native to Zambia on it is mind blowing. Keep growing and we will support the cause.
5,It literally has every songgenrepodcast that you could wish for. One think that would make it phenomenal is if there was a sound search for when a song is playing and you want to know what it is like shazam.
1,Annoying! I tried to apply for the free trail for the New Years but it wouldnt take my address! I was trying for a good hour and it wasnt working. I am very annoyed with this as I was looking forward to trying to see if I wanted to invest for premium after a trail. This is inconvenient and the creators had given tips for this kind of issue. It doesnt work. I tried everything they said but it doesnt work. If the creators can see this issue why can it not be improved
1,If you are giving free service with ads why ads are so bad and frustrating. Do you want us to take premium its user choice. Dont behave as if we have done any offence. Respect your users or els it will only take few sec to uninstall your app.
1,Too many ads! There are 3 30 second ads back to back after playing only two songs. They clearly dont care about your experiences unless you pay them.
5,Ive been using Spotify for about 3+ years now & I love this music app. The only negative thing would be the price you have to pay to be a premium member. Maybe if someone has been a premium member for so many months with Spotify then yall could lower the price for those long term customers. Just a thought. All in all great app & I would recommend to friends & family.
4,the only star Spotify doesnt get is the fact that we cant download individual songs. other than that everythings cool.
5,This app has remixes from Music Artist that Ive been listening to for over a couple of decades now that I didnt even know existed when it came to particular songs overall this app is really good.
5,It selects music based on your taste makes best mix tape which makes things easier. Thank you for your effort and dedication on this app
2,Are you punishing people for downloading your app with so exorbitant ads?! Wanted a playlist with instrumental music while studying ended up getting 4 ads after every 5 minutes bit of music. Messed up both the music and studies obviously.
1,Keeps putting songs Ive hidden in my suggested songs when I listen to my liked songs play list. I dont like these songs theyre completely different from what I listen to and just dont understand why it keeps putting them on literally only when Ive run out of skips and Im not going to get premium because the artists dont get paid nearly enough for their music to be on this app.
3,I cant use the app properly. Its not working. I refresh my phone and the app too many times but still not opening. I love Spotify and I hope this issue will be fixed.
1,One day I was able to switch between songs and fast forward or go back a song but now I cant anymore. Its always telling me to buy premium. And I HATE when songs that are recommending are put on my playlist and I cannot fast forward past them. I shouldnt have to pay for wanting to listen to music.
1,It was my favourite app. I feel sorry for artists who have lost a lot of revenue because of spotify and a few months ago the new update made the app extremely slow to load on my phone even though its only a year old. Really sad i cant use a service that i pay for. I also find the podcast advertisements really annoying because Spotify premium is advertised as ad free but when you listen to a podcast you have to listen to at least 3 annoying ads
1,Back to one frkng star. First of all theres the Spotify is trying to play notification bug. But the very worst of it all: WHERE IS THE HIFI you promised!??!?!?!? Also I was keen to try out several playlists only to find out youve completely changed the layout regarding the playlists recently. Quit your standard arrogant text regarding new updates on Play Store and get your @!!?%?�@$ together. Your main strenght was reliability but it seems you cant keep up with that anymore. Such a shame
1,Even though it was communicated that lyrics feature is available for all users globally after more than 1 month later they still couldnt fix the issue with some PREMIUM members who still doesnt have the feature. I find this unacceptable. Please do something and fix the issue.
1,Use to be sooo good back when I had it and when I downloaded (free version) you couldnt pick the song u want to play unless u pay for it. I cant online pay stuff like an app. But probably it is better in the premium vr but cant pay for it soooo yeah 1 star.
2,This app would be good if not for it taking over any device it is on. I start comp. Theres Spotify starting up. I start phone same problem. I know I could change it and problem solved but that is just one example of little annoying little insertions into my daily life. Theres also the fact if I start it on android there is no quick way to stop the app. And even when I do stop it there is still the notification to continue listening I want to. That is not helpful it is annoying and needy
2,The app is good hard to navigate and wont just let you play the song you click on just plays a Playlist with the song in it then if you skip too many songs it tells you that you need premium to skip more songs which I wouldnt need if it just played the song I clicked on
4,Its good but sometimes it doesnt load the music or it plays like 8 seconds of a song then stops and it says no wifi/internet connection when i have it and it just diesnt work at times but when it does work its great.
